# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: Mrs. Watson wants to invest in the real-estate market and has a total budget of at most $760000. She has two choices which include condos and detached houses. Each dollar invested in condos yields a $0.50 profit and each dollar invested in detached houses yields a $1 profit. A minimum of 20% of all money invested must be in condos, and at least $20000 must be in detached houses. Formulate an LP that can be used to maximize total profit earned from Mrs. Watson's investment.

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "InvestmentCondos": "float",
    "InvestmentDetachedHouses": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}'''

Mathematical Formulation:
Sets:
- InvestmentOptions: set of investment types = {Condos, DetachedHouses}

Parameters:
- total_budget: total available investment budget = 760000 dollars
- profit_per_dollar_condos: profit per dollar invested in condos = 0.50 dollars per dollar
- profit_per_dollar_detached: profit per dollar invested in detached houses = 1.00 dollar per dollar
- min_percent_condos: minimum percentage of total investment that must be in condos = 0.20 (20%)
- min_detached_investment: minimum dollar amount that must be invested in detached houses = 20000 dollars

Variables:
- InvestmentCondos: amount invested in condos (continuous variable, ≥ 0) [in dollars]
- InvestmentDetachedHouses: amount invested in detached houses (continuous variable, ≥ 0) [in dollars]

Objective:
- Maximize total profit = (profit_per_dollar_condos * InvestmentCondos) + (profit_per_dollar_detached * InvestmentDetachedHouses)

Constraints:
1. Budget Constraint: InvestmentCondos + InvestmentDetachedHouses ≤ total_budget
2. Detached House Minimum Constraint: InvestmentDetachedHouses ≥ min_detached_investment
3. Condos Investment Ratio Constraint: InvestmentCondos ≥ min_percent_condos * (InvestmentCondos + InvestmentDetachedHouses)

Execution Results:
SUCCESS:
Solution for LP using ortools.linear_solver:
Investment in Condos: $152000.00
Investment in Detached Houses: $608000.00
Total Profit: $684000.00
