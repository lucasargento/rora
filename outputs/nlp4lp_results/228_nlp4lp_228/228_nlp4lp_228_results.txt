# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: A drop-in clinic is performing a test either through the ear or blood. A blood test takes 30 minutes to perform while an ear test takes 5 minutes to perform. Since the blood test is more accurate, at least three times as many blood tests should be performed as ear tests. However, at least 12 ear tests must be administered. If the drop-in clinic operates for 7525 minutes, maximize the number of tests that can be performed.

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "NumberOfBloodTests": "float",
    "NumberOfEarTests": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}'''

Mathematical Formulation:
Sets:
- T: set of test types = {Blood, Ear}

Parameters:
- time_blood = 30 (minutes per blood test)
- time_ear = 5 (minutes per ear test)
- total_operating_time = 7525 (minutes available)
- ratio_blood_to_ear = 3 (for every ear test, at least 3 blood tests must be conducted)
- min_ear_tests = 12 (minimum number of ear tests)

Variables:
- NumberOfBloodTests: integer ≥ 0 (number of blood tests to perform)
- NumberOfEarTests: integer ≥ 0 (number of ear tests to perform)

Objective:
Maximize the total number of tests performed, i.e.
  TotalTests = NumberOfBloodTests + NumberOfEarTests

Constraints:
1. Time Constraint: 30 * NumberOfBloodTests + 5 * NumberOfEarTests ≤ 7525  
  (The combined test durations cannot exceed the clinic’s available time.)
2. Accuracy (Ratio) Constraint: NumberOfBloodTests ≥ 3 * NumberOfEarTests  
  (Blood tests must be at least three times the ear tests.)
3. Minimum Ear Tests Constraint: NumberOfEarTests ≥ 12  
  (At least 12 ear tests must be administered.)

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Based on the Expected Output Schema, here is the corresponding JSON output:

{
  "variables": {
    "NumberOfBloodTests": "integer >= 0",
    "NumberOfEarTests": "integer >= 0"
  },
  "objective": "Maximize NumberOfBloodTests + NumberOfEarTests under the constraints: 30*NumberOfBloodTests + 5*NumberOfEarTests <= 7525, NumberOfBloodTests >= 3*NumberOfEarTests, and NumberOfEarTests >= 12."
}

Execution Results:
SUCCESS:
Results for the Linear Program Model:
Status             : OPTIMAL
NumberOfBloodTests : 237.0
NumberOfEarTests   : 79.0
Objective value    : 316.0


Expected Output:
Expected solution

: {'variables': {'NumberOfBloodTests': 237.0, 'NumberOfEarTests': 79.0}, 'objective': 316.0}
