# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: A patient with a sore throat can drink two syrups, syrup 1 and syrup 2 for treatment. Per serving, syrup 1 delivers 0.5 units of medicine to the throat and 0.4 units of medicine to the lungs. Per serving, syrup 2 delivers 0.2 units of medicine to the throat and 0.5 units of medicine to the lungs. Furthermore, syrup 1 contains 0.5 units of sugar while syrup 2 contains 0.3 units of sugar per serving. The patient can get at most 5 units of medicine for the throat and at least 4 units of medicine to the lungs. How many servings of each should the patient take to minimize his sugar intake?

Mathematical Formulation:
Sets:
- Syrups: the set of available syrups = {Syrup1, Syrup2}

Parameters:
- throat_medicine: amount of medicine delivered to the throat per serving
  - For Syrup1: 0.5 units per serving
  - For Syrup2: 0.2 units per serving
- lung_medicine: amount of medicine delivered to the lungs per serving
  - For Syrup1: 0.4 units per serving
  - For Syrup2: 0.5 units per serving
- sugar: amount of sugar per serving in the syrup (in sugar units)
  - For Syrup1: 0.5 units per serving
  - For Syrup2: 0.3 units per serving
- max_throat_medicine: maximum allowed medicine for the throat = 5 units
- min_lung_medicine: minimum required medicine for the lungs = 4 units

Variables:
- servings_Syrup1: number of servings of Syrup1 (continuous, ≥ 0) [servings]
- servings_Syrup2: number of servings of Syrup2 (continuous, ≥ 0) [servings]

Objective:
- Minimize total sugar intake = 0.5 * servings_Syrup1 + 0.3 * servings_Syrup2

Constraints:
1. Throat medicine constraint (upper bound):
   0.5 * servings_Syrup1 + 0.2 * servings_Syrup2 ≤ max_throat_medicine
2. Lung medicine constraint (lower bound):
   0.4 * servings_Syrup1 + 0.5 * servings_Syrup2 ≥ min_lung_medicine

Comments:
- All units are assumed consistent: medicine units per serving and sugar units per serving.
- Decision variables are continuous as fractional servings are allowed unless otherwise specified.
- The constraint on throat medicine is an upper limit while the lung medicine requirement is a lower limit.

Expected Output Schema Example:
{
  "variables": {
    "Servings": {
      "0": "servings_Syrup1 (float)",
      "1": "servings_Syrup2 (float)"
    }
  },
  "objective": "Minimize 0.5 * servings_Syrup1 + 0.3 * servings_Syrup2"
}

Execution Results:
SUCCESS:
Solution for Implementation 1:
{'variables': {'Servings': {'0': 0.0, '1': 8.0}}, 'objective': 2.4}
