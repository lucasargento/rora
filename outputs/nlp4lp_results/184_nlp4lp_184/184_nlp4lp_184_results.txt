# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: A man takes two supplements to get his daily iron and calcium requirements. A pill of supplement A has 5 units of iron and 10 units of calcium. A pill of supplement B contains 4 units of iron and 15 units of calcium.  The man needs a minimum of 40 units of iron and 50 units of calcium per day. If the cost per pill of supplement A is $2 and the cost per pill of supplement B is  $3, how many of each should he buy to minimize costs?

Expected Output Schema:

  "variables": {
    "NumPillsSupplement": {
      "0": "float",
      "1": "float"
    }

Mathematical Formulation:
Sets:
- S: the set of supplements = {A, B}

Parameters:
- iron_in_pill: iron content per pill for each supplement, where iron_in_pill[A] = 5 (units of iron per pill of A) and iron_in_pill[B] = 4 (units of iron per pill of B)
- calcium_in_pill: calcium content per pill for each supplement, where calcium_in_pill[A] = 10 (units of calcium per pill of A) and calcium_in_pill[B] = 15 (units of calcium per pill of B)
- cost_per_pill: cost for each supplement, where cost_per_pill[A] = 2 (dollars per pill of A) and cost_per_pill[B] = 3 (dollars per pill of B)
- required_iron: minimum daily iron requirement = 40 (units)
- required_calcium: minimum daily calcium requirement = 50 (units)

Variables:
- NumPillsSupplement[p] for each p in S where:
  • NumPillsSupplement[A] (number of pills of supplement A) is an integer ≥ 0 (or continuous non-negative if integer integrality is relaxed)
  • NumPillsSupplement[B] (number of pills of supplement B) is an integer ≥ 0 (or continuous non-negative if integer integrality is relaxed)

Objective:
- Minimize total_cost = cost_per_pill[A] * NumPillsSupplement[A] + cost_per_pill[B] * NumPillsSupplement[B]

Constraints:
1. Iron requirement constraint:
   • iron_in_pill[A] * NumPillsSupplement[A] + iron_in_pill[B] * NumPillsSupplement[B] ≥ required_iron
   • That is, 5 * NumPillsSupplement[A] + 4 * NumPillsSupplement[B] ≥ 40

2. Calcium requirement constraint:
   • calcium_in_pill[A] * NumPillsSupplement[A] + calcium_in_pill[B] * NumPillsSupplement[B] ≥ required_calcium
   • That is, 10 * NumPillsSupplement[A] + 15 * NumPillsSupplement[B] ≥ 50

    }
  },
  "objective": "total_cost (minimize): 2 * NumPillsSupplement[A] + 3 * NumPillsSupplement[B]"
}
