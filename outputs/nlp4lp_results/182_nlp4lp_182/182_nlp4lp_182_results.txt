# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: Maple Oil processes three types of crude oil: light oil, non-sticky oil and heavy oil. Each tank of light oil produces a net revenue of $550, each tank of non-sticky oil produces a net revenue of $750, and each tank of heavy oil produces a net revenue of $950. To process a tank of light oil, 3 units of compound A and 3 units of compound B are required. To process a tank of non-sticky oil, 6 units of compound A and 2 units of compound B are required. To process a tank of heavy oil, 9 units of compound A and 3 units of compound B are required. Currently the company has 250 units of compound A and 150 units of compound B to process. How many full or partial tanks of each oil should the company process so that net revenue is maximized?

Mathematical Formulation:
Sets:
- OilTypes: set of oil types = {Light, NonSticky, Heavy}

Parameters:
- revenue[o] : net revenue per tank processed for oil type o [USD per tank]
  • revenue[Light] = 550
  • revenue[NonSticky] = 750
  • revenue[Heavy] = 950
- compoundA_req[o] : amount of Compound A required per tank for oil type o [units per tank]
  • compoundA_req[Light] = 3
  • compoundA_req[NonSticky] = 6
  • compoundA_req[Heavy] = 9
- compoundB_req[o] : amount of Compound B required per tank for oil type o [units per tank]
  • compoundB_req[Light] = 3
  • compoundB_req[NonSticky] = 2
  • compoundB_req[Heavy] = 3
- available_CompoundA: total available units of Compound A = 250 [units]
- available_CompoundB: total available units of Compound B = 150 [units]

Variables:
- tanks[o] : number of tanks processed for oil type o, where o in OilTypes [continuous, nonnegative]
  (Interpretation: Number of full or partial tanks processed for each oil type)

Objective:
- Maximize total net revenue = sum over o in OilTypes of (revenue[o] * tanks[o])
  (Units: USD; Interpretation: Total net revenue from processing tanks)

Constraints:
1. Compound A Constraint:
  sum over o in OilTypes of (compoundA_req[o] * tanks[o]) ≤ available_CompoundA
  (Ensures that Compound A used does not exceed 250 units)

2. Compound B Constraint:
  sum over o in OilTypes of (compoundB_req[o] * tanks[o]) ≤ available_CompoundB
  (Ensures that Compound B used does not exceed 150 units)
