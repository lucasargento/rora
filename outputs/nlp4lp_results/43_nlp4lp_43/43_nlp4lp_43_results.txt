# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: A new fast food place makes wraps and platters. Each wrap requires 5 units of meat and 3 units of rice. Each platter requires 7 units of meant and 5 units of rice. While each wrap takes 10 minutes to make, each platter takes 8 minutes to make. The fast food place must use at least 3000 units of meat and 2500 units of rice. Since wraps are easier to eat on the go, at least 3 times as many wraps need to be made as platter. How many of each should the fast food place make to minimize the total production time?

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "NumberOfWraps": "float",
    "NumberOfPlatters": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}'''

Mathematical Formulation:
Sets:
- Items: the set of food items produced = {Wrap, Platter}

Parameters:
- meat_per_wrap: units of meat required to make one Wrap = 5 (units)
- meat_per_platter: units of meat required to make one Platter = 7 (units)
- rice_per_wrap: units of rice required to make one Wrap = 3 (units)
- rice_per_platter: units of rice required to make one Platter = 5 (units)
- time_per_wrap: production time to make one Wrap = 10 (minutes)
- time_per_platter: production time to make one Platter = 8 (minutes)
- min_meat_usage: minimum required total meat consumption = 3000 (units)
- min_rice_usage: minimum required total rice consumption = 2500 (units)
- wrap_ratio: minimum ratio of Wraps to Platters, meaning Wraps must be at least 3 times the number of Platters

Variables:
- NumberOfWraps: number of Wraps to produce [continuous or integer, ≥ 0] [units]
- NumberOfPlatters: number of Platters to produce [continuous or integer, ≥ 0] [units]

Objective:
Minimize total production time (in minutes) = (time_per_wrap * NumberOfWraps) + (time_per_platter * NumberOfPlatters)

Constraints:
1. Meat usage constraint:
   (meat_per_wrap * NumberOfWraps) + (meat_per_platter * NumberOfPlatters) ≥ min_meat_usage
   i.e., 5 * NumberOfWraps + 7 * NumberOfPlatters ≥ 3000

2. Rice usage constraint:
   (rice_per_wrap * NumberOfWraps) + (rice_per_platter * NumberOfPlatters) ≥ min_rice_usage
   i.e., 3 * NumberOfWraps + 5 * NumberOfPlatters ≥ 2500

3. Wrap-to-Platter ratio constraint:
   NumberOfWraps ≥ wrap_ratio * NumberOfPlatters
   i.e., NumberOfWraps ≥ 3 * NumberOfPlatters

Note: All units (meat units, rice units, minutes) are assumed to be consistent as given in the problem description.
