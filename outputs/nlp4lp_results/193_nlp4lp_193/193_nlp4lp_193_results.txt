# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: Platinum Database sells two types of subscription software packages: a personal license and a commercial license which will cost $550 and $2000 to generate respectively. The marketing department estimates that they can sell at most 300 licenses for both versions combined a month. The profit per personal license is $450 and the profit per commercial version is $1200. If the company does not want to spend more than $400000, how many of each software package should they produce to maximize the profits.

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "NumberOfPersonalLicenses": "float",
    "NumberOfCommercialLicenses": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}'''

Mathematical Formulation:
Sets:
- L: set of license types = {Personal, Commercial}

Parameters:
- cost_Personal = 550 (USD per personal license produced)
- cost_Commercial = 2000 (USD per commercial license produced)
- profit_Personal = 450 (USD profit per personal license)
- profit_Commercial = 1200 (USD profit per commercial license)
- max_total_licenses = 300 (maximum licenses that can be sold per month)
- max_production_budget = 400000 (USD available for production cost)

Variables:
- NumberOfPersonalLicenses: number of personal licenses to produce (integer ≥ 0)
- NumberOfCommercialLicenses: number of commercial licenses to produce (integer ≥ 0)

Objective:
- Maximize total profit = (profit_Personal * NumberOfPersonalLicenses) + (profit_Commercial * NumberOfCommercialLicenses)
  (Note: The profit here is the margin per license after subtracting production costs from revenue or directly given as profit per package.)

Constraints:
1. Sales Constraint: NumberOfPersonalLicenses + NumberOfCommercialLicenses ≤ max_total_licenses
   (This limits the total number of licenses sold per month.)
2. Production Budget Constraint: (cost_Personal * NumberOfPersonalLicenses) + (cost_Commercial * NumberOfCommercialLicenses) ≤ max_production_budget
   (This ensures that the total production cost does not exceed the available USD 400,000 budget.)

Execution Results:
SUCCESS:
Solution from Linear Programming Model:
------------------------------------------------
NumberOfPersonalLicenses: 138.0
NumberOfCommercialLicenses: 162.0
Maximum Profit: 256500.0
