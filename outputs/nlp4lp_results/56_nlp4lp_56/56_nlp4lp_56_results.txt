# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: A bank can build small and large branches to serve their customers. A small branch can serve 50 customers per day and requires 10 bank tellers. A large branch can serve 100 customers per day and requires 15 bank tellers. The bank has available 200 bank tellers and needs to be able to serve at least 1200 customers per day. How many of each branch size should they build to minimize the total number of branches needed?

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "SmallBranches": "float",
    "LargeBranches": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}'''

Mathematical Formulation:
Sets:
- BranchTypes = {Small, Large}

Parameters:
- customers_Small: number of customers served by a small branch per day = 50 (customers/branch/day)
- customers_Large: number of customers served by a large branch per day = 100 (customers/branch/day)
- tellers_Small: number of bank tellers required per small branch = 10 (tellers/branch)
- tellers_Large: number of bank tellers required per large branch = 15 (tellers/branch)
- available_Tellers: total available bank tellers = 200 (tellers)
- min_Customers: minimum customers to be served per day = 1200 (customers/day)

Variables:
- SmallBranches: number of small branches to build [integer, ≥ 0]
- LargeBranches: number of large branches to build [integer, ≥ 0]

Objective:
- Minimize total branches built = SmallBranches + LargeBranches

Constraints:
1. Teller Constraint: tellers_Small * SmallBranches + tellers_Large * LargeBranches ≤ available_Tellers  
   (i.e., 10 * SmallBranches + 15 * LargeBranches ≤ 200)
2. Customer Service Constraint: customers_Small * SmallBranches + customers_Large * LargeBranches ≥ min_Customers  
   (i.e., 50 * SmallBranches + 100 * LargeBranches ≥ 1200)
