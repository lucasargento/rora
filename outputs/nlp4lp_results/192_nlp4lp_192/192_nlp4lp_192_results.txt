# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: A music company produces two types of digital keyboards, one is full-weighted and another is semi-weighted. Both keyboards are sold for $2800 and $2400 respectively. There are about 3500 oscillator chips available every day from which the full-weighted version requires 20 chips while the semi-weighted version requires 15 chips. The company has a total of 6 working hours a day. Both of these keyboards require a production time of 1.2 hours. What should be the manufacturing quantity for each of the keyboards to maximize the total revenue?

Expected Output Schema:

  "variables": {
    "QuantityFullWeighted": "float",
    "QuantitySemiWeighted": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"

Mathematical Formulation:
Sets:
- K: set of keyboard types = {FullWeighted, SemiWeighted}

Parameters:
- price[FullWeighted] = 2800 (revenue per full-weighted keyboard produced in USD per unit)
- price[SemiWeighted] = 2400 (revenue per semi-weighted keyboard produced in USD per unit)
- chipsNeeded[FullWeighted] = 20 (oscillator chips required per full-weighted keyboard, chips per unit)
- chipsNeeded[SemiWeighted] = 15 (oscillator chips required per semi-weighted keyboard, chips per unit)
- totalChips = 3500 (total available oscillator chips per day, in chips)
- productionTimePerUnit = 1.2 (production time required per keyboard, in hours per unit; same for both types)
- totalProductionTime = 6 (total available production time per day, in hours)

Variables:
- QuantityFullWeighted: number of full-weighted keyboards to produce (continuous nonnegative variable, in units)
- QuantitySemiWeighted: number of semi-weighted keyboards to produce (continuous nonnegative variable, in units)

Objective:
- Maximize total revenue = price[FullWeighted] * QuantityFullWeighted + price[SemiWeighted] * QuantitySemiWeighted

Constraints:
1. Chip availability constraint:
   (chipsNeeded[FullWeighted] * QuantityFullWeighted) + (chipsNeeded[SemiWeighted] * QuantitySemiWeighted) ≤ totalChips
2. Production time constraint:
   productionTimePerUnit * (QuantityFullWeighted + QuantitySemiWeighted) ≤ totalProductionTime

Comments:
- It is assumed that fractional production quantities are acceptable (continuous decision variables). If only integer quantities are allowed, then the variables should be defined as integer ≥ 0.
- All time and chip units are consistent with the provided data (hours for production time, chips for chip usage, USD for revenue).
- The objective function considers only revenue since no costs are given.
