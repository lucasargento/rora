# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: A electronics store sells premium desktops with more power as well as regular desktops for everyday use. Each premium desktop costs the store $2000 to make and yields a profit of $500. Each regular desktop costs the store $1000 to make and yields a profit of $300. The store sells at most 200 desktops each month and wants to spend at most $300000 on making the desktops. How many of each should be made and sold to maximize profit?

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "NumPremiumDesktops": "float",
    "NumRegularDesktops": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}'''

Mathematical Formulation:
Below is the five-element structured model for the given optimization problem.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Sets:
- D = {Premium, Regular}  
  (D represents the two desktop types being considered.)

----------------------------------------------------------------
Parameters:
- cost_d: production cost per desktop type d  
  • For Premium desktops: cost_Premium = 2000 (USD per unit)  
  • For Regular desktops: cost_Regular = 1000 (USD per unit)
- profit_d: profit per desktop type d (profit earned per unit sold)  
  • For Premium desktops: profit_Premium = 500 (USD per unit)  
  • For Regular desktops: profit_Regular = 300 (USD per unit)
- max_total_units: maximum desktops that can be produced and sold per month = 200 (units)
- max_production_budget: maximum expenditure on production per month = 300000 (USD)

----------------------------------------------------------------
Variables:
- x_d: number of desktops to produce and sell of type d  
  • x_Premium: number of Premium desktops (decision variable, assumed integer; may be considered as float per provided schema)  
  • x_Regular: number of Regular desktops (decision variable, assumed integer; may be considered as float per provided schema)

For clarity in implementation (and matching the expected output schema), let:
  • NumPremiumDesktops = x_Premium  
  • NumRegularDesktops = x_Regular

----------------------------------------------------------------
Objective:
Maximize total profit, defined as:
  Total Profit = profit_Premium * x_Premium + profit_Regular * x_Regular  
Which, with values substituted, becomes:  
  Maximize 500 * NumPremiumDesktops + 300 * NumRegularDesktops  
(Note: This expression represents net profit based on sales performance. The production costs are taken into account via the production budget constraint.)

----------------------------------------------------------------
Constraints:
1. Production Quantity Constraint  
   The total number of desktops produced cannot exceed the monthly sales capacity:  
     x_Premium + x_Regular ≤ max_total_units  
   (That is, NumPremiumDesktops + NumRegularDesktops ≤ 200.)

2. Production Budget Constraint  
   The total manufacturing cost must not exceed the monthly production budget:  
     cost_Premium * x_Premium + cost_Regular * x_Regular ≤ max_production_budget  
   Substituting the given values:  
     2000 * NumPremiumDesktops + 1000 * NumRegularDesktops ≤ 300000

----------------------------------------------------------------
Expected Output Schema (for clarity):

{
  "variables": {
    "NumPremiumDesktops": "float",
    "NumRegularDesktops": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}

This completes the structured mathematical model for the problem.

Execution Results:
SUCCESS:
Results for Linear Programming Model:
NumPremiumDesktops = 100.0
NumRegularDesktops = 100.0
Objective (Total Profit) = 80000.0


Expected Output:
Expected solution

: {'variables': {'NumPremiumDesktops': 100.0, 'NumRegularDesktops': 100.0}, 'objective': 80000.0}
