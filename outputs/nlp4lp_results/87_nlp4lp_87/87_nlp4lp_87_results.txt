Problem Name: 87_nlp4lp_87

# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: A doctor recommends her patient eat more fish and chicken to increase her protein and iron intake. Each fish meal contains 10 units of protein and 12 units of iron. Each chicken meal contains 15 units of protein and 8 units of iron. The patient needs to consume at least 130 units of protein and 120 units of iron. Since the chicken meal is less expensive, the patient prefers to consume at least twice as many chicken meals as fish meals. If each fish meal contains 7 units of fat and each chicken meal contains 10 units of fat, how many meals of each should she eat to minimize her fat intake?

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "FishMeals": "float",
    "ChickenMeals": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}'''

Mathematical Formulation:
Below is the complete and structured mathematical optimization model using the five-element framework. This model is fully self-contained based on the provided problem data and requirements.

------------------------------------------------------------
Sets:
- Meals: the set of meal types = {Fish, Chicken}

------------------------------------------------------------
Parameters:
- protein_fish: protein per fish meal = 10 units [units of protein/meal]
- protein_chicken: protein per chicken meal = 15 units [units of protein/meal]
- iron_fish: iron per fish meal = 12 units [units of iron/meal]
- iron_chicken: iron per chicken meal = 8 units [units of iron/meal]
- fat_fish: fat per fish meal = 7 units [units of fat/meal]
- fat_chicken: fat per chicken meal = 10 units [units of fat/meal]
- protein_requirement: minimum required protein = 130 units [units of protein]
- iron_requirement: minimum required iron = 120 units [units of iron]
- chicken_to_fish_ratio: minimum ratio of chicken to fish meals = 2  
  (i.e., the number of chicken meals must be at least twice the number of fish meals)

------------------------------------------------------------
Variables:
- FishMeals: number of fish meals consumed [float, continuous, nonnegative]
- ChickenMeals: number of chicken meals consumed [float, continuous, nonnegative]

------------------------------------------------------------
Objective:
Minimize total fat intake:
  TotalFat = fat_fish * FishMeals + fat_chicken * ChickenMeals
In terms of the given parameters:
  Minimize: 7 * FishMeals + 10 * ChickenMeals

------------------------------------------------------------
Constraints:
1. Protein intake constraint:
   protein_fish * FishMeals + protein_chicken * ChickenMeals >= protein_requirement
   i.e., 10 * FishMeals + 15 * ChickenMeals >= 130

2. Iron intake constraint:
   iron_fish * FishMeals + iron_chicken * ChickenMeals >= iron_requirement
   i.e., 12 * FishMeals + 8 * ChickenMeals >= 120

3. Chicken-to-fish meal ratio constraint:
   ChickenMeals >= chicken_to_fish_ratio * FishMeals
   i.e., ChickenMeals >= 2 * FishMeals

------------------------------------------------------------
Model Comments:
- All units are assumed to be consistent per meal as described.
- Although meals are discrete in practice, the variables are modeled as continuous (float) as defined in the expected output schema.
- The objective focuses solely on minimizing fat intake, while nutritional constraints ensure the patient meets her protein and iron needs, and the preference for a higher count of chicken meals is also respected.

------------------------------------------------------------
Expected Output Schema (for reference in implementation):
{
  "variables": {
    "FishMeals": "float",
    "ChickenMeals": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}
