Problem Name: 219_nlp4lp_219

# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: A production company needs to transport their equipment and staff for a movie they are shooting using large mobile production units or small mobile production units. Large mobile production units can hold 6 people and takes up 2 parking spots whereas small mobile production units can hold only 2 people and takes up 1 parking spot. Movie stars prefer to have their small mobile production unit to share with a close staff, therefore at least 5 units must be small mobile units. However, due to logistic limitations, large mobile production units are more space efficient per spot, they must make up at least 75% of all vehicles. If the movie needs to transport 80 people, minimize the total number of parking spots required by this production.

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "NumberLargeUnits": "float",
    "NumberSmallUnits": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}'''

Mathematical Formulation:
Below is a complete formulation of the problem using the five-element modeling framework.

--------------------------------------------------

Sets:
• No explicit sets are needed since the decision is over two vehicle types (large and small). You can think of the vehicle types as an implicit set V = {Large, Small}.

Parameters:
• capacityLarge = 6           // Number of people that a large unit can transport [people/unit]
• capacitySmall = 2           // Number of people that a small unit can transport [people/unit]
• parkingLarge = 2            // Number of parking spots a large unit occupies [spots/unit]
• parkingSmall = 1            // Number of parking spots a small unit occupies [spots/unit]
• requiredPeople = 80         // Total number of people that must be transported [people]
• minSmallUnits = 5           // Minimum number of small mobile units required [units]
• minLargeFraction = 0.75     // Minimum required fraction of large units among all vehicles [dimensionless]

Variables:
• LargeUnits: number of large mobile production units used [integer, ≥ 0]
• SmallUnits: number of small mobile production units used [integer, ≥ 0]

Note: We assume that vehicles are integer quantities. If fractional vehicles are considered (e.g., for planning relaxations), change the type accordingly.

Objective:
• Minimize total parking spots required.
  Expressed as: Minimize TotalParking = parkingLarge * LargeUnits + parkingSmall * SmallUnits
  [Objective: minimize spots (units: spots)]

Constraints:
1. People transport capacity:
   capacityLarge * LargeUnits + capacitySmall * SmallUnits ≥ requiredPeople
   (Ensures that the chosen fleet can transport at least 80 people.)

2. Minimum small units requirement:
   SmallUnits ≥ minSmallUnits
   (At least 5 small units must be used.)

3. Large unit fleet composition constraint:
   The large units must be at least 75% of all vehicles. In equation form:
   LargeUnits / (LargeUnits + SmallUnits) ≥ minLargeFraction
   This inequality can be rearranged (assuming LargeUnits + SmallUnits > 0) to:
   LargeUnits ≥ (minLargeFraction / (1 - minLargeFraction)) * SmallUnits
   With minLargeFraction = 0.75, note that (0.75 / (1-0.75)) = 3, so this constraint becomes:
   LargeUnits ≥ 3 * SmallUnits

--------------------------------------------------

The following JSON schema summarizes the key decision variables and the objective value:

{
  "variables": {
    "NumberLargeUnits": "integer (≥ 0)",
    "NumberSmallUnits": "integer (≥ 0)"
  },
  "objective": "Total parking spots used = 2 * NumberLargeUnits + 1 * NumberSmallUnits"
}

--------------------------------------------------

This formulation is now complete, self-contained, and fully reflects the requirements stated in the original problem.

Execution Results:
SUCCESS:
Solving production transportation problem using two formulations.

Integer Model (Vehicles as Integers):
  NumberLargeUnits = 15
  NumberSmallUnits = 5
  Total Parking Spots = 35.0

---------------------------

Continuous Model (Vehicles as Continuous Variables):
  NumberLargeUnits = 15.0
  NumberSmallUnits = 5.0
  Total Parking Spots = 35.0
