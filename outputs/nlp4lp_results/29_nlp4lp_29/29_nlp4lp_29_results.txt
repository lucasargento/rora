# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: A berry farmer has two farms, an old and new farm, where he grows raspberries, blueberries, and strawberries. He has a contract to provide a local store with 10 kg of raspberries, 9 kg of blueberries, and 15 kg of strawberries. At his old farm, it cost $300 to operate per day and he can harvest and deliver 2 kg of raspberries, 2 kg of blueberries, and 4 kg of strawberries in a day. At his new farm, it costs $200 to operate per day and he can harvest and deliver 4 kg of raspberries, 1 kg of blueberries, and 2 kg of strawberries in a day. Formulate a LP to meet his contract while minimizing his cost.

Mathematical Formulation:
Sets:
• Farms: {Old, New}
• Crops: {Raspberries, Blueberries, Strawberries}

Parameters:
• cost_f: Daily operating cost for each farm f:
  – cost_Old = 300 dollars per day
  – cost_New = 200 dollars per day
• prod_f_c: Daily production (in kg) of crop c at farm f:
  – For Old: prod_Old_Raspberries = 2, prod_Old_Blueberries = 2, prod_Old_Strawberries = 4
  – For New: prod_New_Raspberries = 4, prod_New_Blueberries = 1, prod_New_Strawberries = 2
• req_c: Contract requirement (in kg) for each crop c:
  – req_Raspberries = 10
  – req_Blueberries = 9
  – req_Strawberries = 15

Variables:
• days_f: Number of days to operate farm f (continuous, nonnegative), where f ∈ {Old, New}
  – For example, days_Old and days_New represent the days of operation at the Old and New farms respectively.

Objective:
• Minimize total operating cost:
  Minimize: total_cost = cost_Old * days_Old + cost_New * days_New
  That is, minimize 300 * days_Old + 200 * days_New

Constraints:
• Meeting the raspberries contract:
  2 * days_Old + 4 * days_New >= 10
• Meeting the blueberries contract:
  2 * days_Old + 1 * days_New >= 9
• Meeting the strawberries contract:
  4 * days_Old + 2 * days_New >= 15
• Nonnegativity:
  days_Old >= 0, days_New >= 0

Notes:
• All units are in dollars for costs and kilograms for production and requirements.
• It is assumed that operating a farm for a fractional number of days is acceptable. If days must be integer, then the variable type should be changed accordingly.

This structured model is complete and ready to be translated into a working LP implementation.

Execution Results:
SUCCESS:
----- Continuous LP Model -----
Optimal days operated at old farm: 4.333333333333333
Optimal days operated at new farm: 0.33333333333333326
Total operating cost: $ 1366.6666666666667

----- Integer LP Model -----
Optimal days operated at old farm: 4.0
Optimal days operated at new farm: 1.0
Total operating cost: $ 1400.0
