# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: A coffee shop sells mochas and regular coffees. Each mocha requires 3 units of coffee powder and 6 units of milk. Each regular coffee requires 6 units of coffee powder and 2 units of milk. The shop has available 400 units of coffee powder and 500 units of milk. Making a mocha takes 5 minutes and making a regular coffee takes 3 minutes. Since mochas are more popular among people, the shop must make at least 3 times as many mochas as regular coffees. How many of each should they make to minimize the total production time?

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "NumMocha": "float",
    "NumRegularCoffee": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}'''

Mathematical Formulation:
Sets:
- Drinks: a set of coffee drink types = {Mocha, RegularCoffee}

Parameters:
- coffeePowderPerMocha = 3 (units of coffee powder required per mocha)
- coffeePowderPerRegular = 6 (units of coffee powder required per regular coffee)
- milkPerMocha = 6 (units of milk required per mocha)
- milkPerRegular = 2 (units of milk required per regular coffee)
- availableCoffeePowder = 400 (total available units of coffee powder)
- availableMilk = 500 (total available units of milk)
- productionTimeMocha = 5 (minutes required to make one mocha)
- productionTimeRegular = 3 (minutes required to make one regular coffee)
- minMochaToRegularRatio = 3 (mochas must be at least 3 times the number of regular coffees)

Variables:
- NumMocha: number of mochas to produce (float, ≥ 0) [units]
- NumRegularCoffee: number of regular coffees to produce (float, ≥ 0) [units]

Objective:
- Minimize total production time in minutes = productionTimeMocha * NumMocha + productionTimeRegular * NumRegularCoffee
  That is, minimize (5 * NumMocha + 3 * NumRegularCoffee)

Constraints:
1. Coffee powder constraint:
   3 * NumMocha + 6 * NumRegularCoffee ≤ 400
2. Milk constraint:
   6 * NumMocha + 2 * NumRegularCoffee ≤ 500
3. Demand ratio constraint:
   NumMocha ≥ 3 * NumRegularCoffee

Comments:
- All unit quantities are assumed to be consistent (e.g., production time in minutes, material usage in units).
- Although production quantities are typically integers, the expected output schema specifies float variables for NumMocha and NumRegularCoffee.
- This model minimizes the total production time subject to resource and ratio constraints, and is ready to be implemented using Python or OR-Tools code.

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "NumMocha": "float",
    "NumRegularCoffee": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}

Execution Results:
SUCCESS:
Solution using ortools.linear_solver:
{'variables': {'NumMocha': 0.0, 'NumRegularCoffee': 0.0}, 'objective': 0.0}


Expected Output:
Expected solution

: {'variables': {'NumMocha': -0.0, 'NumRegularCoffee': -0.0}, 'objective': 0.0}
