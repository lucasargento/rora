# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: A concert organizer has to transport equipment using carts or trolleys. Carts can transport 5 kg/min of equipment and requires 2 workers. Trolleys can transport 7 kg/min of equipment and requires 4 workers. There must be at least 12 trolleys to be used. Additionally, only a maximum of 40% of the transportation can be using trolleys. The organizer has to deliver at a rate of 100 kg/min of equipment. How many of each transportation method should be used to minimize the total number of workers?

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "NumberOfCarts": "float",
    "NumberOfTrolleys": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}'''

Mathematical Formulation:
Sets:
- M: set of transportation methods = {Cart, Trolley}

Parameters:
- capacity_cart = 5        // Equipment delivered per cart in kg per minute
- capacity_trolley = 7     // Equipment delivered per trolley in kg per minute
- workers_cart = 2         // Workers required per cart
- workers_trolley = 4      // Workers required per trolley
- required_delivery = 100  // Total required delivery rate in kg per minute
- min_trolleys = 12        // At least 12 trolleys must be used
- max_trolley_share = 0.4  // Maximum share (40%) of total delivery that can come from trolleys

Variables:
- NumberOfCarts, representing the number of carts used [decision variable, continuous (or integer if enforced) and ≥ 0]
- NumberOfTrolleys, representing the number of trolleys used [decision variable, continuous (or integer if enforced) and ≥ 0]

Objective:
- Minimize total workers required = workers_cart * NumberOfCarts + workers_trolley * NumberOfTrolleys

Constraints:
1. Delivery Requirement: 
   capacity_cart * NumberOfCarts + capacity_trolley * NumberOfTrolleys ≥ required_delivery
   (i.e., 5 * NumberOfCarts + 7 * NumberOfTrolleys ≥ 100)

2. Minimum Trolley Usage:
   NumberOfTrolleys ≥ min_trolleys
   (i.e., NumberOfTrolleys ≥ 12)

3. Trolley Share Limitation:
   The equipment delivered by trolleys may not exceed max_trolley_share of the total equipment delivered. That is,
   capacity_trolley * NumberOfTrolleys ≤ max_trolley_share * (capacity_cart * NumberOfCarts + capacity_trolley * NumberOfTrolleys)
   (i.e., 7 * NumberOfTrolleys ≤ 0.4 * (5 * NumberOfCarts + 7 * NumberOfTrolleys))

Comments:
- All rates and capacities are given in kg per minute and workers per vehicle.
- Although the decision variables could be naturally integer, the output schema indicates their type as "float". Adjust integrality constraints as needed in implementation.
- The third constraint ensures that at most 40% of the total transportation (by kg/min) is provided by trolleys.

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "NumberOfCarts": "float",
    "NumberOfTrolleys": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}

Execution Results:
SUCCESS:
Continuous Model (variables as float):
{'variables': {'NumberOfCarts': 25.200000000000003, 'NumberOfTrolleys': 12.0}, 'objective': 98.4}

Integer Model (variables as integer):
{'variables': {'NumberOfCarts': 26.0, 'NumberOfTrolleys': 12.0}, 'objective': 100.0}


Expected Output:
