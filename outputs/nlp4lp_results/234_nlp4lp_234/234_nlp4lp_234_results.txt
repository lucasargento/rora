Problem Name: 234_nlp4lp_234

# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: A village delivers mail to nearby villages either by runners or canoers. Runners can carry three bags of mail each time and takes 4 hours. Canoers can carry ten bags of mail each time and takes 2 hours. At most 33% of deliveries can be by canoe. Additionally, the village can spare at most 200 total hours and at least 4 runners must be used. How many of each way to deliver must be used to maximize the total amount of mail that can be delivered?

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "NumRunnerTrips": "float",
    "NumCanoeTrips": "float",
    "NumberOfRunners": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}'''

Mathematical Formulation:
Below is one complete formulation that faithfully translates the problem into a structured five‐element model.

--------------------------------------------------

Sets:
• DeliveryModes = {Runner, Canoe}
  (This set distinguishes the two types of delivery methods.)

Parameters:
• bag_capacity_runner = 3                [mail bags per runner trip]
• bag_capacity_canoe = 10                [mail bags per canoe trip]
• time_runner_trip = 4                   [hours per runner trip]
• time_canoe_trip = 2                    [hours per canoe trip]
• max_total_time = 200                   [total available delivery hours]
• max_canoe_fraction = 0.33              [maximum fraction of trips that may be by canoe]
• min_runners = 4                        [minimum number of distinct runners required]
• Note: We assume that each runner makes a single trip. (Alternatively, if runners can make multiple trips then a linking constraint between trips and number of runners would be needed. For this model we assume one trip per runner so that NumberOfRunners equals the number of runner trips.)

Variables:
• NumRunnerTrips: integer ≥ 0  
  (Number of trips made on foot by runners)
• NumCanoeTrips: integer ≥ 0  
  (Number of trips made by canoe)
• NumberOfRunners: integer ≥ 0  
  (Number of distinct runners employed; will be forced to be at least min_runners)

Objective:
• Maximize TotalMailDelivered = bag_capacity_runner * NumRunnerTrips + bag_capacity_canoe * NumCanoeTrips  
  [mail bags delivered]

Constraints:
1. Total time available:
   time_runner_trip * NumRunnerTrips + time_canoe_trip * NumCanoeTrips ≤ max_total_time

2. Canoe delivery fraction:
   NumCanoeTrips ≤ max_canoe_fraction * (NumRunnerTrips + NumCanoeTrips)
   (This ensures that at most 33% of all deliveries are by canoe.)

3. Minimum number of runners:
   NumberOfRunners ≥ min_runners

4. Linking runners and runner trips (based on the assumption that each runner can only make one trip):
   NumRunnerTrips ≤ NumberOfRunners
   (If, in another formulation, runners can make multiple trips then a different linking constraint would be required.)

--------------------------------------------------

The expected output schema (using the variable names defined above) is:

{
  "variables": {
    "NumRunnerTrips": "integer, number of trips by runners",
    "NumCanoeTrips": "integer, number of trips by canoe",
    "NumberOfRunners": "integer, number of distinct runners used (must be at least 4)"
  },
  "objective": "Maximize TotalMailDelivered = 3 * NumRunnerTrips + 10 * NumCanoeTrips"
}

This structured model is self-contained and can be implemented in a working optimization code.

Execution Results:
