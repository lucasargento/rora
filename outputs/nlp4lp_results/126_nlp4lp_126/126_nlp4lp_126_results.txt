# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: A bee farmer transports his honey in small and large bottles. A small bottle can take 5 units of honey while a large bottle can take 20 units of honey. The farmer has available at most 300 small bottles and at most 100 large bottles. In addition, since small bottles are easier to sell, at least twice as many small bottles must be used than large bottles. Finally, he can transport at most 200 bottles total and at least 50 must be large bottles. How many of each bottle should be use to maximize the total amount of honey he can transport?

Expected Output Schema:

  "variables": {
    "SmallBottlesUsed": "float",
    "LargeBottlesUsed": "float"

Mathematical Formulation:
Sets:
- BottleTypes = {Small, Large}

Parameters:
- capacity_small: honey capacity per small bottle [units] = 5
- capacity_large: honey capacity per large bottle [units] = 20
- max_small: maximum available small bottles [bottles] = 300
- max_large: maximum available large bottles [bottles] = 100
- max_total_bottles: maximum total bottles that can be transported [bottles] = 200
- min_large_used: minimum large bottles to use [bottles] = 50
- small_to_large_ratio: minimum ratio of small bottles to large bottles = 2  (i.e., number of small bottles used must be at least twice the number of large bottles used)

Variables:
- x_small: number of small bottles to use [integer, units = bottles]
- x_large: number of large bottles to use [integer, units = bottles]

Objective:
- Maximize total honey transported = (capacity_small * x_small) + (capacity_large * x_large)

Constraints:
1. Availability constraints:
   - x_small <= max_small
   - x_large <= max_large

2. Total bottle constraint:
   - x_small + x_large <= max_total_bottles

3. Ratio constraint:
   - x_small >= small_to_large_ratio * x_large

4. Minimum large bottle usage constraint:
   - x_large >= min_large_used

Comments:
- All decision variables are assumed to be integer since the number of bottles must be whole numbers.
- The units for capacities are in "units of honey" (e.g., liters, kilograms) as described in the problem but no specific unit was provided.
- This model maximizes the total transported honey subject to the available bottle counts and additional constraints.
