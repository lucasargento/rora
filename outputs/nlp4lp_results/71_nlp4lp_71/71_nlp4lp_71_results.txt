# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: An accounting firm employs part time workers and full time workers. Full time workers work 8 hours per shift while part time workers work 4 hours per shift. In addition, full time workers are paid $300 per shift while part time workers are paid $100 per shift. Currently, the accounting firm has a project requiring 500 hours of labor. If the firm has a budget of $15000, how many of each type of worker should be scheduled to minimize the total number of workers.

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "NumFullTimeWorkers": "float",
    "NumPartTimeWorkers": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}'''

Mathematical Formulation:
Sets:
- WorkerTypes = {FullTime, PartTime}

Parameters:
- FullTimeShiftHours = 8  // hours of work per full-time worker shift
- PartTimeShiftHours = 4  // hours of work per part-time worker shift
- FullTimeCost = 300  // cost per full-time worker shift in USD
- PartTimeCost = 100  // cost per part-time worker shift in USD
- RequiredLaborHours = 500  // total labor hours needed for the project
- AvailableBudget = 15000  // total available budget in USD

Variables:
- NumFullTimeWorkers: number of full-time workers scheduled (integer, ≥ 0)
- NumPartTimeWorkers: number of part-time workers scheduled (integer, ≥ 0)

Objective:
- Minimize total number of workers = NumFullTimeWorkers + NumPartTimeWorkers

Constraints:
1. Labor Hours Constraint:
  FullTimeShiftHours * NumFullTimeWorkers + PartTimeShiftHours * NumPartTimeWorkers ≥ RequiredLaborHours
  → 8 * NumFullTimeWorkers + 4 * NumPartTimeWorkers ≥ 500

2. Budget Constraint:
  FullTimeCost * NumFullTimeWorkers + PartTimeCost * NumPartTimeWorkers ≤ AvailableBudget
  → 300 * NumFullTimeWorkers + 100 * NumPartTimeWorkers ≤ 15000

----------------------------------

Following the Expected Output Schema, the key decision variables and the objective are represented as:

{
  "variables": {
    "NumFullTimeWorkers": "float", 
    "NumPartTimeWorkers": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}

Execution Results:
SUCCESS:
========== Optimization Results ==========
Optimal Solution Found:
 - Number of Full-Time Workers: 25.0
 - Number of Part-Time Workers: 75.0
 - Total Number of Workers (Objective Value): 100.0


Expected Output:
Expected solution

: {'variables': {'NumFullTimeWorkers': 25.0, 'NumPartTimeWorkers': 75.0}, 'objective': 100.0}
