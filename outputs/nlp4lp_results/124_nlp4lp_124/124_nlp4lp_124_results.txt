# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: A clinic administers two vaccines available for the public to take one at a time. One vaccine is taken as a pill and another is taken as a shot. The pill vaccine takes 10 minutes to administer while the shot takes 20 minutes to administer. Since the shot has been more thoroughly studied, the clinic must deliver at least 3 times as many shots as pill. In addition, the clinic must administer at least 30 pill vaccines. If the clinic only operates for 10000 minutes, maximize the number of patients that can be vaccinated.

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "NumberOfPills": "float",
    "NumberOfShots": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}'''

Mathematical Formulation:
Sets:
- V: set of vaccine types = {pill, shot}

Parameters:
- time_pill: time required to administer a pill vaccine (minutes) = 10
- time_shot: time required to administer a shot vaccine (minutes) = 20
- min_pill: minimum number of pill vaccines to administer [units] = 30
- min_shot_factor: factor required such that number of shots ≥ min_shot_factor * number of pills = 3
- total_operating_time: total available operating time (minutes) = 10000

Variables:
- NumberOfPills: number of pill vaccines administered [integer ≥ 0] [units]
- NumberOfShots: number of shot vaccines administered [integer ≥ 0] [units]

Objective:
- Maximize total patients vaccinated = NumberOfPills + NumberOfShots

Constraints:
1. Time Constraint: (time_pill * NumberOfPills) + (time_shot * NumberOfShots) ≤ total_operating_time  
   (i.e., 10 * NumberOfPills + 20 * NumberOfShots ≤ 10000)
2. Shot-Pill Ratio Constraint: NumberOfShots ≥ min_shot_factor * NumberOfPills  
   (i.e., NumberOfShots ≥ 3 * NumberOfPills)
3. Minimum Pill Constraint: NumberOfPills ≥ min_pill  
   (i.e., NumberOfPills ≥ 30)
