# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: Ayse produces a plant growth compound by mixing two types of fertilizer: C and Y. This growth compound must contain at least 5 units of nitrous oxide and 8 units of vitamin mix. Fertilizer C and Y cost $2 and $3 per kg respectively. Fertilizer C contains 1.5 units of nitrous oxide per kg and 3 units of vitamin mix per kg. Fertilizer Y contains 5 units of nitrous oxide per kg and 1 unit of vitamin mix per kg. Determine the minimum cost of Ayse's compound.

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "FertilizerQuantity": [
      "float"
    ]
  },
  "objective": "float"
}'''

Mathematical Formulation:
Sets:
- F: set of fertilizers = {C, Y}

Parameters:
- cost_f: cost per kg for fertilizer f [USD/kg], where cost_C = 2 and cost_Y = 3.
- nitrous_f: units of nitrous oxide per kg for fertilizer f, where nitrous_C = 1.5 and nitrous_Y = 5.
- vitamin_f: units of vitamin mix per kg for fertilizer f, where vitamin_C = 3 and vitamin_Y = 1.
- min_nitrous: minimum required units of nitrous oxide = 5 [units].
- min_vitamin: minimum required units of vitamin mix = 8 [units].

Variables:
- x_f: quantity (kg) of fertilizer f used in the compound [continuous, x_f ≥ 0].

Objective:
- Minimize total cost = cost_C * x_C + cost_Y * x_Y [USD].

Constraints:
- Nitrous oxide requirement: nitrous_C * x_C + nitrous_Y * x_Y ≥ min_nitrous.
- Vitamin mix requirement: vitamin_C * x_C + vitamin_Y * x_Y ≥ min_vitamin.

Notes:
- All costs are in USD per kg.
- The nutrient content for each fertilizer is given per kg. Ensure that the total nutrients from the mix meet or exceed the minimum requirements.
- x_f are continuous variables representing the weight in kilograms of each fertilizer used.
