# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: A volunteer organization transports voters to the polls on Election Day either by vans or cars. They have vans which can carry 6 people and cars which can carry 3 people.  They need to transport at least 200 voters to the polls. In addition, at most 30% of the vehicles can be vans. How many of each vehicle should be used to minimize the total number of cars used?

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "NumberOfVans": "float",
    "NumberOfCars": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}'''

Mathematical Formulation:
Sets:
- V: set of vehicle types = {van, car}

Parameters:
- capacity_van: capacity per van [voters per van] = 6
- capacity_car: capacity per car [voters per car] = 3
- min_voters: minimum number of voters to transport [voters] = 200
- max_fraction_vans: maximum allowed fraction of vans in the fleet [unitless] = 0.30

Variables:
- NumberOfVans: number of vans used [integer ≥ 0]
- NumberOfCars: number of cars used [integer ≥ 0]

Objective:
- Minimize the total number of cars used, i.e., Minimize NumberOfCars

Constraints:
1. Voter Transport Constraint: 
   6 * NumberOfVans + 3 * NumberOfCars ≥ min_voters

2. Vehicle Composition Constraint (at most 30% vans):
   NumberOfVans ≤ max_fraction_vans * (NumberOfVans + NumberOfCars)
   (Alternatively, this constraint can be rearranged as 7 * NumberOfVans ≤ 3 * NumberOfCars.)

Comments:
- All vehicle counts are assumed to be integers. If fractional values are acceptable in a relaxed model, the variables may be considered as nonnegative floats.
- Capacity units are expressed in voters per vehicle.
- The reformulated vehicle composition constraint ensures that vans do not exceed 30% of the total vehicles.

Output as JSON following the expected output schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "NumberOfVans": "float",
    "NumberOfCars": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}

Execution Results:
SUCCESS:
{
  "Model1": {
    "NumberOfVans": 15.0,
    "NumberOfCars": 37.0,
    "objective": 37.0
  },
  "Model2": {
    "NumberOfVans": 15.0,
    "NumberOfCars": 37.0,
    "objective": 37.0
  }
}


Expected Output:
