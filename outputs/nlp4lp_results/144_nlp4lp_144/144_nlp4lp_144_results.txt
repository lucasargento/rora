# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: A theme park transports its visitors around the park either by scooter or rickshaw. A scooter can carry 2 people while a rickshaw can carry 3 people. To avoid excessive pollution, at most 40% of the vehicles used can be rickshaws. If the park needs to transport at least 300 visitors, minimize the total number of scooters used.

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "NumScooters": "float",
    "NumRickshaws": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}'''

Mathematical Formulation:
Sets:
- V: set of vehicle types = {Scooter, Rickshaw}  
  (Note: Though vehicles have different capacities, we separate them by type.)

Parameters:
- capacity_Scooter: passenger capacity of one scooter = 2 visitors per scooter  
- capacity_Rickshaw: passenger capacity of one rickshaw = 3 visitors per rickshaw  
- min_passengers: minimum number of visitors to transport = 300 visitors  
- max_rickshaw_fraction: maximum fraction of vehicles that can be rickshaws = 0.40 (or 40%)

Variables:
- NumScooters: number of scooters to deploy [continuous integer variable; units: vehicles]  
- NumRickshaws: number of rickshaws to deploy [continuous integer variable; units: vehicles]

Objective:
- Minimize NumScooters  
  (Interpretation: The goal is to reduce the number of scooters used while still transporting at least 300 visitors and observing the pollution constraint on rickshaws.)

Constraints:
1. Passenger Capacity Constraint:  
   (capacity_Scooter * NumScooters) + (capacity_Rickshaw * NumRickshaws) ≥ min_passengers  
   (Ensures that at least 300 visitors are transported.)

2. Rickshaw Ratio Constraint:  
   NumRickshaws ≤ max_rickshaw_fraction * (NumScooters + NumRickshaws)  
   (Ensures that at most 40% of all vehicles are rickshaws.)

Comments:
- All units are assumed consistent in visitors per vehicle and vehicles count.  
- Decision variables are assumed to be integers. If fractional vehicles are not allowed in implementation, the variable type should be set to integer.  
- The objective solely minimizes the number of scooters used, which indirectly encourages maximizing the use of rickshaws without breaching the rickshaw fraction limit.

Execution Results:
SUCCESS:
Results for Model 1 (Linear/MIP formulation):
variables: {'NumScooters': 75.0, 'NumRickshaws': 50.0}
objective: 75.0


Expected Output:
