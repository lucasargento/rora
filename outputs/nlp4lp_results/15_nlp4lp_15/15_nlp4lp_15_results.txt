# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: A hobbyist makes model trains and planes using wood and paint. A model train requires 3 units of wood and 3 units of paint. A model plane requires 4 units of wood and 2 units of paint. The hobbyist has available 120 units of wood and 90 units of paint. If the profit per model train is $8 and the profit per model plane is $10, how many of each should be made to maximize his profit?

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "NumberOfTrains": "float",
    "NumberOfPlanes": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}'''

Mathematical Formulation:
Sets:
- Products: {Train, Plane}

Parameters:
- profit_Product: profit per unit produced [USD per unit] where
  - profit_Train = 8
  - profit_Plane = 10
- woodRequired_Product: units of wood required per unit produced [wood units per unit] where
  - woodRequired_Train = 3
  - woodRequired_Plane = 4
- paintRequired_Product: units of paint required per unit produced [paint units per unit] where
  - paintRequired_Train = 3
  - paintRequired_Plane = 2
- availableWood: total available wood [wood units] = 120
- availablePaint: total available paint [paint units] = 90

Variables:
- NumberOfTrains: number of model trains to produce (decision variable, continuous nonnegative value; in practical implementation, you may require integer values)
- NumberOfPlanes: number of model planes to produce (decision variable, continuous nonnegative value; in practical implementation, you may require integer values)

Objective:
- Maximize total profit = (profit_Train * NumberOfTrains) + (profit_Plane * NumberOfPlanes)
  - This represents the total revenue from selling the produced models.

Constraints:
1. Wood constraint: (woodRequired_Train * NumberOfTrains) + (woodRequired_Plane * NumberOfPlanes) ≤ availableWood  
   i.e., 3*NumberOfTrains + 4*NumberOfPlanes ≤ 120
2. Paint constraint: (paintRequired_Train * NumberOfTrains) + (paintRequired_Plane * NumberOfPlanes) ≤ availablePaint  
   i.e., 3*NumberOfTrains + 2*NumberOfPlanes ≤ 90
3. Nonnegativity constraints:
   - NumberOfTrains ≥ 0
   - NumberOfPlanes ≥ 0
