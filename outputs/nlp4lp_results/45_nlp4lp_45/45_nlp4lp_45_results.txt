Problem Name: 45_nlp4lp_45

# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: A honey farmer sells his honey in glass and plastic jars. A glass jar can hold 250 ml of honey while a plastic jar can hold 300 ml of honey. Since glass jars are more expensive, at least twice as many plastic jars must be filled as glass jars. However, at least 20 glass jars should be filled. If the farmer has 20000 ml of honey, how many jars of each should be filled to maximize the total number of bottles filled?

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "GlassJarsFilled": "float",
    "PlasticJarsFilled": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}'''

Mathematical Formulation:
Below is the complete structured model using the five-element framework.

-------------------------------------------------

Sets:
- Jars: {Glass, Plastic}

Parameters:
- glass_capacity: capacity of one glass jar (250 ml per jar)
- plastic_capacity: capacity of one plastic jar (300 ml per jar)
- total_honey: total available honey (20000 ml)
- min_glass: minimum number of glass jars that must be filled (20 jars)
- plastic_to_glass_ratio: minimum ratio of plastic to glass jars that must be filled (at least 2 plastic jars per glass jar)

Variables:
- GlassJarsFilled: number of glass jars filled [integer, ≥ 0]
- PlasticJarsFilled: number of plastic jars filled [integer, ≥ 0]

Objective:
- Maximize the total jars filled = GlassJarsFilled + PlasticJarsFilled

Constraints:
1. Honey Availability Constraint:
   (glass_capacity * GlassJarsFilled) + (plastic_capacity * PlasticJarsFilled) ≤ total_honey
   i.e., 250 * GlassJarsFilled + 300 * PlasticJarsFilled ≤ 20000

2. Ratio Constraint:
   PlasticJarsFilled ≥ plastic_to_glass_ratio * GlassJarsFilled
   i.e., PlasticJarsFilled ≥ 2 * GlassJarsFilled

3. Minimum Glass Jars Requirement:
   GlassJarsFilled ≥ min_glass
   i.e., GlassJarsFilled ≥ 20

Below is a JSON representation of the variables and objective as specified:

{
  "variables": {
    "GlassJarsFilled": "float",
    "PlasticJarsFilled": "float"
  },
  "objective": "maximize (GlassJarsFilled + PlasticJarsFilled)"
}

Execution Results:
SUCCESS:
Optimal solutions for all implementations:
Implementation 1: {'variables': {'GlassJarsFilled': 23.0, 'PlasticJarsFilled': 47.0}, 'objective': 70.0}


Expected Output:
