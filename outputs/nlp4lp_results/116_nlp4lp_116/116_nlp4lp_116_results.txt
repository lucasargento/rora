# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: A popup clinic is doing virus testing with either spit tests or swabs. A spit test takes 10 minutes to administer while a  swab takes 15 minutes to administer. Since the spit test is more accurate, at least twice as many spit tests should be given as  swabs. However, at least 20  swabs must be administers. If the popup clinic operates for 8000 minutes, maximize the number of tests that can be administered.

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "NumberOfSpitTests": "float",
    "NumberOfSwabTests": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}'''

Mathematical Formulation:
Sets:
- T: set of test types = {Spit, Swab}

Parameters:
- time_Spit: time to administer one spit test = 10 (minutes per test)
- time_Swab: time to administer one swab test = 15 (minutes per test)
- total_operating_time: available clinic operating time = 8000 (minutes)
- min_swab_tests: minimum number of swab tests = 20 (tests)
- spit_swab_ratio: minimum ratio of spit tests to swab tests = 2 (i.e., number of spit tests must be ≥ 2 × number of swab tests)

Variables:
- NumberOfSpitTests: number of spit tests administered [float, nonnegative]
- NumberOfSwabTests: number of swab tests administered [float, nonnegative]

Objective:
- Maximize total tests administered = NumberOfSpitTests + NumberOfSwabTests

Constraints:
1. Time constraint: (time_Spit × NumberOfSpitTests) + (time_Swab × NumberOfSwabTests) ≤ total_operating_time
2. Accuracy constraint: NumberOfSpitTests ≥ spit_swab_ratio × NumberOfSwabTests
3. Minimum swab tests: NumberOfSwabTests ≥ min_swab_tests

Comments:
- All time units are in minutes.
- Although tests are countable items and typically should be integers, the variable type is specified as float per the expected output schema.
- The objective is to maximize the total number of administered tests under the available operating time and quality constraints.

Execution Results:
