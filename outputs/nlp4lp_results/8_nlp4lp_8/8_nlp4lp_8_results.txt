# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: A grocery store wants to liquidate its stock of 10 apples, 20 bananas, and 80 grapes. Given past experience, the store knows that they can propose a banana-haters package with 6 apples and 30 grapes and that this package will bring a profit of six euros. Similarly, they can prepare a combo package with 5 apples, 6 bananas, and 20 grapes, yielding a profit of seven euros. They know they can sell any quantity of these two packages within the availability of its stock. What quantity of each package, banana-haters packages and combo packages, should the store prepare to maximize net profit?

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "PackageCount": {
      "0": "float",
      "1": "float"
    }
  },
  "objective": "float"
}'''

Mathematical Formulation:
Sets:
- Packages: P = {BH, Combo}, where BH represents the banana-haters package and Combo represents the combo package.

Parameters:
- stock_apples = 10 (units available)
- stock_bananas = 20 (units available)
- stock_grapes = 80 (units available)
- apples_BH = 6 (apples required per banana-haters package)
- grapes_BH = 30 (grapes required per banana-haters package)
- apples_Combo = 5 (apples required per combo package)
- bananas_Combo = 6 (bananas required per combo package)
- grapes_Combo = 20 (grapes required per combo package)
- profit_BH = 6 (euros profit per banana-haters package)
- profit_Combo = 7 (euros profit per combo package)

Variables:
- x_BH: number of banana-haters packages to prepare (continuous or integer ≥ 0)
- x_Combo: number of combo packages to prepare (continuous or integer ≥ 0)

Objective:
- Maximize total profit = (profit_BH * x_BH) + (profit_Combo * x_Combo)

Constraints:
1. Apple stock constraint:
   - (apples_BH * x_BH) + (apples_Combo * x_Combo) ≤ stock_apples
   - That is: 6*x_BH + 5*x_Combo ≤ 10

2. Banana stock constraint:
   - (bananas_Combo * x_Combo) ≤ stock_bananas
   - That is: 6*x_Combo ≤ 20
   - (Note: The banana-haters package does not use bananas.)

3. Grape stock constraint:
   - (grapes_BH * x_BH) + (grapes_Combo * x_Combo) ≤ stock_grapes
   - That is: 30*x_BH + 20*x_Combo ≤ 80

This structured model fully represents the original problem using the five-element framework.

Execution Results:
SUCCESS:
Solution for Pure Linear Model:
Banana-haters package count (x_BH): 0.0
Combo package count (x_Combo): 2.0
Maximum Profit: 14.0

Structured Solution Output:
{'variables': {'PackageCount': {'0': 0.0, '1': 2.0}}, 'objective': 14.0}


Expected Output:
Expected solution

: {'variables': {'PackageCount': {'0': -0.0, '1': 2.0}}, 'objective': 14.0}
