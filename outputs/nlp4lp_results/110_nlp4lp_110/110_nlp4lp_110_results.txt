# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: A zookeeper feeds a gorilla with bananas and mangoes. Each banana contains 80 calories, 20 grams of potassium, and 10 grams of sugar. Each mango contains 100 calories, 15 grams of potassium, and 8 grams of sugar.  The gorilla must consume at least 4000 calories and 150 grams of potassium. Since the gorilla prefers bananas, at most 33% of the fruits he eats can be mangoes. If excess sugar makes the gorilla aggressive, how many of each fruit should he consume to minimize his sugar intake?

    "XBanana": "float",

Mathematical Formulation:
Sets:
- F: set of fruits = {Banana, Mango}

Parameters:
- banana_cal: calories per banana [80 calories/banana]
- banana_potassium: potassium per banana [20 grams/banana]
- banana_sugar: sugar per banana [10 grams/banana]
- mango_cal: calories per mango [100 calories/mango]
- mango_potassium: potassium per mango [15 grams/mango]
- mango_sugar: sugar per mango [8 grams/mango]
- min_calories: minimum total calories required [4000 calories]
- min_potassium: minimum total potassium required [150 grams]
- max_frac_mango: maximum fraction of mangoes in total fruits [0.33]

Variables:
- XBanana: number of bananas to feed the gorilla [continuous, nonnegative, units: bananas]
- XMango: number of mangoes to feed the gorilla [continuous, nonnegative, units: mangoes]

Objective:
- Minimize total sugar intake = banana_sugar * XBanana + mango_sugar * XMango  
  (i.e., minimize 10 * XBanana + 8 * XMango)

Constraints:
1. Calorie Constraint:
   - banana_cal * XBanana + mango_cal * XMango >= min_calories  
   (i.e., 80 * XBanana + 100 * XMango >= 4000)

2. Potassium Constraint:
   - banana_potassium * XBanana + mango_potassium * XMango >= min_potassium  
   (i.e., 20 * XBanana + 15 * XMango >= 150)

3. Fruit Preference (Mango Limit) Constraint:
   - XMango <= max_frac_mango * (XBanana + XMango)  
   (i.e., XMango <= 0.33 * (XBanana + XMango))
   
Notes:
- All parameter units are consistent with the description.
- The decision variables are modeled as continuous; if discrete fruit counts are required, the variables can be forced to integer.
- The constraint XMango <= 0.33*(XBanana+XMango) ensures that the number of mangoes does not exceed 33% of the total fruits.

Output Schema (as required):
{
  "variables": {
    "XBanana": "float",
    "XMango": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}

Execution Results:
SUCCESS:
Optimization Results (Linear Formulation):
XBanana = 30.946882217090067
XMango = 15.242494226327947
Objective (Minimized Sugar) = 431.4087759815243
