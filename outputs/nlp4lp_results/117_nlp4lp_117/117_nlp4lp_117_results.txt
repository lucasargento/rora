# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: A patient is undergoing radiation treatment involving two beams, Beam 1 and Beam 2. Beam 1 delivers a dose of 0.3 units of medicine per minute to the benign area of the pancreas and 0.2 units of medicine per minute to the benign area of the skin. Beam 2 delivers 0.2 units of medicine per minute to the benign area of the pancreas and 0.1 units of medicine per minute to the benign area of the skin.  In addition, beam 1 delivers 0.6 units of medicine per minute to the tumor and beam 2 delivers 0.4 units of medicine per minute to the tumor. At most 4 units of medicine should be received by the skin and at least 3 units of medicine should be delivered to the tumor.  How many minutes of each beam should be used to minimize the total radiation received by the pancreas?

Mathematical Formulation:
Sets:
- B: set of beams = {Beam1, Beam2}

Parameters:
- pancreas_rate: dose delivered to the pancreas per minute
  - For Beam1: 0.3 [units/minute]
  - For Beam2: 0.2 [units/minute]
- skin_rate: dose delivered to the skin per minute
  - For Beam1: 0.2 [units/minute]
  - For Beam2: 0.1 [units/minute]
- tumor_rate: dose delivered to the tumor per minute
  - For Beam1: 0.6 [units/minute]
  - For Beam2: 0.4 [units/minute]
- max_skin_dose: maximum dose allowed for the skin = 4 [units]
- min_tumor_dose: minimum dose required for the tumor = 3 [units]

Variables:
- MinutesBeam1: continuous variable representing the number of minutes to use Beam1 [minutes, ≥ 0]
- MinutesBeam2: continuous variable representing the number of minutes to use Beam2 [minutes, ≥ 0]

Objective:
- Minimize total dose to the pancreas = 0.3 * MinutesBeam1 + 0.2 * MinutesBeam2

Constraints:
1. Skin dose constraint:
   - 0.2 * MinutesBeam1 + 0.1 * MinutesBeam2 ≤ max_skin_dose
2. Tumor dose constraint:
   - 0.6 * MinutesBeam1 + 0.4 * MinutesBeam2 ≥ min_tumor_dose

Notes:
- All units are assumed to be consistent (dose units per minute and minutes for time).
- The decision variables (MinutesBeam1 and MinutesBeam2) are continuous, non-negative values.
- The model aims to minimize the harm to the pancreas by reducing its radiation exposure while satisfying the treatment requirements for the skin and tumor.
