# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: A hospital prepares batches of medication patches and anti-biotic creams. Each medication patch requires 3 minutes to prepare and 5 units of materials. Each anti-biotic cream requires 5 minutes to prepare and 6 units of materials. Since anti-biotic creams are used more often, there must be at least twice as many anti-biotic creams as medication patches. Due to storage reasons, the hospital can make at most 100 batches of medication patches and anti-biotic creams in total. The hospital has available 400 minutes of staff to spare and 530 units of materials. If each batch of medication patches can treat 3 people and each batch of anti-biotic cream can treat 2 people, how many batches of each should be made to maximize the number of people that can be treated?

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "NumBatchesAntiBioticCream": "float",
    "NumBatchesMedicationPatch": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}'''

Mathematical Formulation:
Sets:
- P: set of product types = {MedicationPatch, AntiBioticCream}

Parameters:
- prepTimePatch: preparation time per batch of medication patches [minutes] = 3
- materialPatch: material required per batch of medication patches [material units] = 5
- treatPatch: number of people treated per batch of medication patches [people per batch] = 3
- prepTimeCream: preparation time per batch of anti-biotic creams [minutes] = 5
- materialCream: material required per batch of anti-biotic creams [material units] = 6
- treatCream: number of people treated per batch of anti-biotic creams [people per batch] = 2
- totalStaffTime: total staff time available [minutes] = 400
- totalMaterial: total material available [material units] = 530
- totalBatchesLimit: maximum total batches that can be stored [batches] = 100

Variables:
- NumBatchesMedicationPatch: number of batches of medication patches produced [non-negative real number]
- NumBatchesAntiBioticCream: number of batches of anti-biotic creams produced [non-negative real number]

Objective:
- Maximize the total number of people treated:
  Maximize (treatPatch * NumBatchesMedicationPatch + treatCream * NumBatchesAntiBioticCream)
  which translates to: Maximize (3 * NumBatchesMedicationPatch + 2 * NumBatchesAntiBioticCream)

Constraints:
1. Staff time constraint:
   (prepTimePatch * NumBatchesMedicationPatch + prepTimeCream * NumBatchesAntiBioticCream) ≤ totalStaffTime
   → 3 * NumBatchesMedicationPatch + 5 * NumBatchesAntiBioticCream ≤ 400
2. Material constraint:
   (materialPatch * NumBatchesMedicationPatch + materialCream * NumBatchesAntiBioticCream) ≤ totalMaterial
   → 5 * NumBatchesMedicationPatch + 6 * NumBatchesAntiBioticCream ≤ 530
3. Storage (batch) constraint:
   NumBatchesMedicationPatch + NumBatchesAntiBioticCream ≤ totalBatchesLimit
   → NumBatchesMedicationPatch + NumBatchesAntiBioticCream ≤ 100
4. Demand ratio constraint:
   The number of anti-biotic cream batches must be at least twice the number of medication patch batches:
   → NumBatchesAntiBioticCream ≥ 2 * NumBatchesMedicationPatch
5. Non-negativity:
   NumBatchesMedicationPatch ≥ 0, NumBatchesAntiBioticCream ≥ 0

Model Comments:
- Units are consistent: time in minutes and materials in material units.
- While batches are typically integers, the model variables are defined as non-negative real numbers (floats) to match the expected output schema. Adjust to integer requirements if necessary.

Execution Results:
SUCCESS:
