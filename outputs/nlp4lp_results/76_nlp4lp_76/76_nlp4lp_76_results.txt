Problem Name: 76_nlp4lp_76

# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: A small chocolate shop makes milk chocolate and dark chocolate bars. Milk chocolate bars require 4 units of cocoa and 7 units of milk. Dark chocolate bars require 6 units of cocoa and 3 units of milk. The shop has 2000 units of cocoa and 1750 units of milk available. In addition since milk chocolate sells better, at least 2 times as many milk chocolate bars need to be made as dark chocolate bars.  If making a milk chocolate bar takes 15 minutes and making a dark chocolate bar takes 12 mins, how many of each should the make to minimize total production time?

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "MilkBars": "float",
    "DarkBars": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}'''

Mathematical Formulation:
Below is a complete and unambiguous mathematical model using the five-element structure.

--------------------------------------------------
Sets:
- P: set of chocolate bar types = {Milk, Dark}

--------------------------------------------------
Parameters:
- Cocoa_per_Milk: cocoa units required per milk chocolate bar = 4 [units/bar]
- Cocoa_per_Dark: cocoa units required per dark chocolate bar = 6 [units/bar]
- Milk_per_Milk: milk units required per milk chocolate bar = 7 [units/bar]
- Milk_per_Dark: milk units required per dark chocolate bar = 3 [units/bar]
- Total_Cocoa: total available cocoa = 2000 [units]
- Total_Milk: total available milk = 1750 [units]
- Time_Milk: production time per milk chocolate bar = 15 [minutes/bar]
- Time_Dark: production time per dark chocolate bar = 12 [minutes/bar]
- Ratio_Min: minimum ratio of milk chocolate bars to dark chocolate bars = 2 [milk bars per dark bar]

--------------------------------------------------
Variables:
- MilkBars: number of milk chocolate bars produced [nonnegative integer; units: bars]
- DarkBars: number of dark chocolate bars produced [nonnegative integer; units: bars]

--------------------------------------------------
Objective:
- Minimize total production time = (Time_Milk * MilkBars) + (Time_Dark * DarkBars)
  which translates to: Minimize 15 * MilkBars + 12 * DarkBars [minutes]

--------------------------------------------------
Constraints:
1. Cocoa availability constraint:
   4 * MilkBars + 6 * DarkBars ≤ 2000
   (Total cocoa used by both types cannot exceed available cocoa.)

2. Milk availability constraint:
   7 * MilkBars + 3 * DarkBars ≤ 1750
   (Total milk used by both types cannot exceed available milk.)

3. Production ratio constraint:
   MilkBars ≥ 2 * DarkBars
   (At least two milk chocolate bars must be produced for every dark chocolate bar.)

--------------------------------------------------

Additional Comments:
- All units are clearly stated in the parameter definitions.
- Decision variables are assumed to be integers since they represent countable bars. However, if divisibility is acceptable (or for relaxation purposes), they may be treated as continuous nonnegative variables.
- The model is self-contained and avoids duplications by directly referencing parameters in constraints and the objective.
- This complete formulation can be directly mapped to code using Python or OR-Tools.
