# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: A water salesman collects water from a glacier and transports it in either small or large kegs. A small keg can hold 40 liters of water while a large keg can hold 100 liters of water. The salesman has available at most 30 small kegs and 10 large kegs. Since small kegs are easier to carry, at least twice as may small kegs must be used than large kegs. If he can transport at most 25 kegs total and at least 5 kegs must be large, how many of each should he use to maximize the total amount of glacial water he can transport?

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "NumSmallKegsUsed": "float",
    "NumLargeKegsUsed": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}'''

Mathematical Formulation:
Sets:
- Kegs: {Small, Large}

Parameters:
- CapacitySmall: capacity of a small keg in liters = 40 liters
- CapacityLarge: capacity of a large keg in liters = 100 liters
- MaxSmallKegsAvailable: maximum number of small kegs available = 30
- MaxLargeKegsAvailable: maximum number of large kegs available = 10
- MaxTotalKegsTransport: maximum number of kegs that can be transported = 25
- MinLargeKegsRequired: minimum number of large kegs to be used = 5
- MinSmallToLargeRatio: required ratio such that the number of small kegs used is at least twice that of large kegs (i.e., SmallKegsUsed >= 2 * LargeKegsUsed)

Variables:
- NumSmallKegsUsed: number of small kegs to use [integer, 0 <= NumSmallKegsUsed <= MaxSmallKegsAvailable]
- NumLargeKegsUsed: number of large kegs to use [integer, 0 <= NumLargeKegsUsed <= MaxLargeKegsAvailable]

Objective:
- Maximize TotalWaterTransported, where TotalWaterTransported = (CapacitySmall * NumSmallKegsUsed) + (CapacityLarge * NumLargeKegsUsed)
  (The unit is liters)

Constraints:
1. Keg Availability Constraints:
   - NumSmallKegsUsed <= MaxSmallKegsAvailable
   - NumLargeKegsUsed <= MaxLargeKegsAvailable
2. Total Kegs Constraint:
   - NumSmallKegsUsed + NumLargeKegsUsed <= MaxTotalKegsTransport
3. Minimum Large Kegs Constraint:
   - NumLargeKegsUsed >= MinLargeKegsRequired
4. Small-to-Large Ratio Constraint:
   - NumSmallKegsUsed >= MinSmallToLargeRatio * NumLargeKegsUsed

Comments:
- All parameters are in consistent units (kegs for counts and liters for volume).
- The decision variables are modeled as integers although the expected output schema mentions floats; in practice, kegs must be whole numbers.
- The model maximizes the total liters of glacial water that can be transported.

This structured model is self-contained and ready to be implemented in Python or OR-Tools code.

Execution Results:
