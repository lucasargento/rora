# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: A clothing company can sell their product in two types of stores, a retail store and a factory outlet. A retail store brings in 200 customers every day and requires 6 employees to operate. A factory outlet brings in 80 customers every day and due to the lower traffic and being in more remote areas, requires 4 employees to run. Company executives decided that there must be at least 1200 customers every day, and can make available 50 employees. How should the company distribute their product to the two types of store to reduce the number of stores that must be open?

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "NumberRetailStores": "float",
    "NumberFactoryOutlets": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}'''

Mathematical Formulation:
Sets:
- S: set of store types = {RetailStore, FactoryOutlet}

Parameters:
- customers_retail: number of customers a retail store attracts per day = 200 [customers/day]
- employees_retail: number of employees required per retail store = 6 [employees/store]
- customers_factory: number of customers a factory outlet attracts per day = 80 [customers/day]
- employees_factory: number of employees required per factory outlet = 4 [employees/store]
- min_customers: minimum number of customers required per day = 1200 [customers/day]
- available_employees: total employees available = 50 [employees]

Variables:
- NumberRetailStores: number of retail stores to open (integer, ≥ 0) [stores]
- NumberFactoryOutlets: number of factory outlets to open (integer, ≥ 0) [stores]

Objective:
- Minimize total number of open stores = NumberRetailStores + NumberFactoryOutlets

Constraints:
1. Customer Requirement: (customers_retail * NumberRetailStores) + (customers_factory * NumberFactoryOutlets) ≥ min_customers  
   i.e., 200 * NumberRetailStores + 80 * NumberFactoryOutlets ≥ 1200
2. Employee Availability: (employees_retail * NumberRetailStores) + (employees_factory * NumberFactoryOutlets) ≤ available_employees  
   i.e., 6 * NumberRetailStores + 4 * NumberFactoryOutlets ≤ 50

Comments:
- All parameter units are consistent: customer counts per day and employee counts.
- The decision variables should preferably be integers since partial stores are not meaningful.
- This model minimizes the total number of stores while ensuring at least 1200 daily customers are reached and employee usage does not exceed the 50 available employees.
