# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: A construction company in the tropics uses cows and elephants to carry bricks. A cow can carry 20 bricks on its back while an elephant can carry 50 bricks on its back. To avoid having elephants create too much traffic, the number of elephant cannot exceed the number of cows. In addition, there can be at most twice the number of cows as elephants. If the company needs to transport at least 1000 bricks, find the minimum number of animals, cows and elephants, that can be used..

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "NumberOfCows": "float",
    "NumberOfElephants": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}'''

Mathematical Formulation:
Sets:
- A: set of animal types = {Cow, Elephant}

Parameters:
- capacityCow: number of bricks a cow can carry, with value 20 (bricks per cow)
- capacityElephant: number of bricks an elephant can carry, with value 50 (bricks per elephant)
- minBricks: minimum number of bricks to transport, with value 1000 (bricks)

Variables:
- NumberOfCows: number of cows used (nonnegative integer; decision variable, units: animals)
- NumberOfElephants: number of elephants used (nonnegative integer; decision variable, units: animals)

Objective:
- Minimize totalAnimals = NumberOfCows + NumberOfElephants

Constraints:
1. Brick Capacity Constraint: capacityCow * NumberOfCows + capacityElephant * NumberOfElephants >= minBricks  
   (i.e., 20 * NumberOfCows + 50 * NumberOfElephants >= 1000)
2. Elephant Traffic Constraint: NumberOfElephants <= NumberOfCows  
   (ensuring elephants do not outnumber cows to lessen traffic)
3. Cow Ratio Constraint: NumberOfCows <= 2 * NumberOfElephants  
   (ensuring the number of cows is at most twice the number of elephants)

Note: Although cows and elephants are inherently integer choices, the provided expected output schema lists them as floats. They can be treated as integers in implementation if required.

Output Format (as per expected output schema):
{
  "variables": {
    "NumberOfCows": "float",
    "NumberOfElephants": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}

Execution Results:
SUCCESS:
Solution using OR-Tools Linear Solver:
{'variables': {'NumberOfCows': 15.0, 'NumberOfElephants': 14.0}, 'objective': 29.0}


Expected Output:
Expected solution

: {'variables': {'NumberOfCows': 15.0, 'NumberOfElephants': 14.0}, 'objective': 29.0}
