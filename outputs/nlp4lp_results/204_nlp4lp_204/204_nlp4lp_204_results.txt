# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: An oil and gas company has two types of pipes, a high-volume and a low-volume one. Every day, the high-volume pipe allows 10000 US gallons and it is recommended that 12 technicians closely monitor the pipes to ensure that it is functioning properly. Each day, the low-volume pipe allows 5000 US gallons and 5 technicians should closely monitor for safety reasons. Every day, the oil and gas company needs to meet the demands of at least 150000 US gallons of gas and they have 160 technicians that are on their staff. Since the high-volume pipe has a higher risk of environmental damage, at most 35 percent of the pipes can be high-volume ones. Additionally, there must be a minimum of 8 low-volume pipes. How many of each pipe types should be used to reduce the total number of pipes required?

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "HighVolumePipes": "float",
    "LowVolumePipes": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}'''

Mathematical Formulation:
Sets:
- PIPETYPE: set of pipe types = {HighVolume, LowVolume}

Parameters:
- high_flow: gallons of gas per high-volume pipe per day = 10000 (US gallons)
- low_flow: gallons of gas per low-volume pipe per day = 5000 (US gallons)
- high_tech_required: technicians required per high-volume pipe per day = 12 (technicians)
- low_tech_required: technicians required per low-volume pipe per day = 5 (technicians)
- min_total_flow: minimum gas flow required per day = 150000 (US gallons)
- available_techs: total technicians available per day = 160 (technicians)
- max_high_percentage: maximum fraction of high-volume pipes allowed = 0.35 (35 percent)
- min_low_pipes: minimum number of low-volume pipes required = 8 (pipes)

Variables:
- HighVolumePipes: number of high-volume pipes to use (integer, ≥ 0)
- LowVolumePipes: number of low-volume pipes to use (integer, ≥ 0)

Objective:
- Minimize total number of pipes = HighVolumePipes + LowVolumePipes

Constraints:
1. Gas Flow Constraint:
   - high_flow * HighVolumePipes + low_flow * LowVolumePipes ≥ min_total_flow
   - Meaning: 10000 * HighVolumePipes + 5000 * LowVolumePipes ≥ 150000

2. Technician Constraint:
   - high_tech_required * HighVolumePipes + low_tech_required * LowVolumePipes ≤ available_techs
   - Meaning: 12 * HighVolumePipes + 5 * LowVolumePipes ≤ 160

3. High-Volume Pipe Percentage Constraint:
   - HighVolumePipes ≤ max_high_percentage * (HighVolumePipes + LowVolumePipes)
   - Meaning: HighVolumePipes ≤ 0.35 * (HighVolumePipes + LowVolumePipes)

4. Low-Volume Pipes Minimum Constraint:
   - LowVolumePipes ≥ min_low_pipes
   - Meaning: LowVolumePipes ≥ 8

---

Note:
- All units are assumed consistent. Gallons refer to US gallons and technician counts are per day.
- The decision variables are integers. In some implementations, you might relax integrality if pipes can be considered in continuous approximation, but here pipes are discrete items.
- The model minimizes the total number of pipes while ensuring the gas flow demand is met, technician availability is not exceeded, and safety/environmental policies are observed.

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "HighVolumePipes": "integer ≥ 0",
    "LowVolumePipes": "integer ≥ 0"
  },
  "objective": "minimize HighVolumePipes + LowVolumePipes"
}
