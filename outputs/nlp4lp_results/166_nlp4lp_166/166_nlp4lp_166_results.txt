# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: Employees have the option of car-pooling to work or taking the company bus. A car can take 4 employees and produces 10 units of pollution, while a bus can take 20 employees and produces 30 units of pollution. At least 300 employees need to be transported and at most 4 buses can be used. How many of each type of transport should be taken to minimize the total pollution produced.

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "xCars": "float",
    "xBuses": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}'''

Mathematical Formulation:
Sets:
- T: set of transport types = {Car, Bus}

Parameters:
- capacity_Car: number of employees that can be transported by one car = 4 [employees per car]
- capacity_Bus: number of employees that can be transported by one bus = 20 [employees per bus]
- pollution_Car: pollution produced by one car = 10 [pollution units per car]
- pollution_Bus: pollution produced by one bus = 30 [pollution units per bus]
- min_employees: minimum number of employees to transport = 300 [employees]
- max_buses: maximum number of buses allowed = 4 [buses]

Variables:
- xCars: number of cars to be used [integer, ≥ 0, units: vehicles]
- xBuses: number of buses to be used [integer, ≥ 0, units: vehicles]

Objective:
- Minimize total pollution = pollution_Car * xCars + pollution_Bus * xBuses

Constraints:
- Employee Transport Constraint: capacity_Car * xCars + capacity_Bus * xBuses ≥ min_employees  
  (This ensures that the total number of employees that can be transported meets or exceeds 300.)
- Bus Limit Constraint: xBuses ≤ max_buses  
  (This ensures that at most 4 buses are used.)

Execution Results:
SUCCESS:
Solution using ortools.linear_solver:
{'variables': {'xCars': 55.0, 'xBuses': 4.0}, 'objective': 670.0}
