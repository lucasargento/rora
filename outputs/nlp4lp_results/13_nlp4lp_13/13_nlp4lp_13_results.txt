# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: My family has decided to invest in real state for the first time. Currently, they have $600,000 to invest, some in apartments and the rest in townhouses. The money invested in apartments must not be greater than $200,000. They have decided that the money invested in apartments must be at least a half as much as that in townhouses.  If the apartments earn 10%, and the townhouses earn 15%, how much money should they invest in each to maximize profit?

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "InvestmentApartments": "float",
    "InvestmentTownhouses": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}'''

Mathematical Formulation:
Sets:
- S: set of property types = {Apartments, Townhouses}

Parameters:
- TotalInvestment: total available funds for investment = 600000 (USD)
- MaxApartmentInvestment: maximum allowed funds for apartments = 200000 (USD)
- ReturnApartment: profit rate for apartments = 0.10 (profit per dollar)
- ReturnTownhouse: profit rate for townhouses = 0.15 (profit per dollar)
- MinApartmentToTownhouseRatio: minimum ratio of apartment investment to townhouse investment = 0.5

Variables:
- InvestmentApartments: amount invested in apartments (continuous, USD, ≥ 0)
- InvestmentTownhouses: amount invested in townhouses (continuous, USD, ≥ 0)

Objective:
- Maximize total profit = (ReturnApartment × InvestmentApartments) + (ReturnTownhouse × InvestmentTownhouses)

Constraints:
1. Budget constraint: InvestmentApartments + InvestmentTownhouses ≤ TotalInvestment
2. Apartment cap: InvestmentApartments ≤ MaxApartmentInvestment
3. Ratio constraint: InvestmentApartments ≥ MinApartmentToTownhouseRatio × InvestmentTownhouses
4. Nonnegativity: InvestmentApartments ≥ 0 and InvestmentTownhouses ≥ 0

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "InvestmentApartments": "float",
    "InvestmentTownhouses": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}

Execution Results:
SUCCESS:
Results for Investment Optimization Model:
InvestmentApartments = 200000.0
InvestmentTownhouses = 400000.0
Optimal Profit = 80000.0
