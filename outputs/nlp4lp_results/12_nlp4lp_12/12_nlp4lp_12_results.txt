# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: An art store makes large and small art pieces. The store has available 100 units of paint, 50 units of glitter, and 70 units of glue. To make a large art piece requires 4 units of paint, 3 units of glitter, and 5 units of glue. To make a small art piece requires 2 units of paint, 1 unit of glitter, and 2 units of glue. The store must make at least 5 units of each large and small art pieces. If the profit per large art piece is $30 and the profit per small art piece is $15, how many of each should be made to maximize profit?

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "NumberLarge": "float",
    "NumberSmall": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}'''

Mathematical Formulation:
Sets:
- P: set of art piece types = {Large, Small}

Parameters:
- total_paint: 100 (total available paint units)
- total_glitter: 50 (total available glitter units)
- total_glue: 70 (total available glue units)
- paint_usage_Large: 4 (paint units required per large art piece)
- glitter_usage_Large: 3 (glitter units required per large art piece)
- glue_usage_Large: 5 (glue units required per large art piece)
- paint_usage_Small: 2 (paint units required per small art piece)
- glitter_usage_Small: 1 (glitter unit required per small art piece)
- glue_usage_Small: 2 (glue units required per small art piece)
- profit_Large: 30 (profit per large art piece in dollars)
- profit_Small: 15 (profit per small art piece in dollars)
- min_production: 5 (minimum number of each art piece to be made)

Variables:
- NumberLarge: integer decision variable representing the number of large art pieces produced (units, integer ≥ min_production)
- NumberSmall: integer decision variable representing the number of small art pieces produced (units, integer ≥ min_production)

Objective:
- Maximize Total Profit = profit_Large * NumberLarge + profit_Small * NumberSmall

Constraints:
1. Paint constraint: paint_usage_Large * NumberLarge + paint_usage_Small * NumberSmall ≤ total_paint
2. Glitter constraint: glitter_usage_Large * NumberLarge + glitter_usage_Small * NumberSmall ≤ total_glitter
3. Glue constraint: glue_usage_Large * NumberLarge + glue_usage_Small * NumberSmall ≤ total_glue
4. Minimum production for large art pieces: NumberLarge ≥ min_production
5. Minimum production for small art pieces: NumberSmall ≥ min_production

Notes:
- All units in the parameters are consistent with the respective resource quantities in the problem statement.
- The decision variables are defined as integers because the art pieces are discrete items.
- This model assumes that all resource usage (paint, glitter, and glue) is consumed at the time of production and that the available units of each resource are fully available in the production period.
