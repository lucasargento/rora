# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: An industrial tire company delivers large tires for equipment to remote engineering sites either by cargo planes or ultrawide trucks. Each cargo plane can transport 10 tires per trip and costs $1000. Each ultrawide truck can transport 6 tires per trip and costs $700. The company needs to transport at least 200 tires and has available $22000. Because most remote sites don't have proper airports, the number of plane trips cannot exceed the number of ultrawide truck trips. How many trips of each should be done to minimize the total number of trips?

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "PlaneTrips": "float",
    "TruckTrips": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}'''

Mathematical Formulation:
Sets:
- TransportModes: the set of delivery methods available = {Plane, Truck}

Parameters:
- plane_capacity: tires delivered per plane trip = 10 tires/trip
- truck_capacity: tires delivered per truck trip = 6 tires/trip
- plane_cost: cost per plane trip = 1000 dollars/trip
- truck_cost: cost per truck trip = 700 dollars/trip
- tire_requirement: minimum number of tires to transport = 200 tires
- available_budget: maximum spending available = 22000 dollars
- Note: All monetary units are in US dollars, capacities in number of tires, and trips are counted by number of trips.

Variables:
- PlaneTrips: number of cargo plane trips (continuous variable, but representable as integer in practice, measured in trips; units: trips)
- TruckTrips: number of ultrawide truck trips (continuous variable, but representable as integer in practice, measured in trips; units: trips)

Objective:
- Minimize total trips: TotalTrips = PlaneTrips + TruckTrips

Constraints:
1. Tire delivery requirement:
   - 10 * PlaneTrips + 6 * TruckTrips >= 200
   (The total number of tires delivered must be at least 200.)

2. Budget constraint:
   - 1000 * PlaneTrips + 700 * TruckTrips <= 22000
   (Total transportation cost cannot exceed 22000 dollars.)

3. Mode balance constraint:
   - PlaneTrips <= TruckTrips
   (Since many remote sites do not have proper airports, the number of plane trips is not allowed to exceed the number of truck trips.)

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "PlaneTrips": "float",
    "TruckTrips": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}

Execution Results:
SUCCESS:
{
  "variables": {
    "PlaneTrips": 11.0,
    "TruckTrips": 15.0
  },
  "objective": 26.0
}


Expected Output:
