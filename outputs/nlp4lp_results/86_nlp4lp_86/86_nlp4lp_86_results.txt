# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: A drug company is making allergy pills and fever reducing pills in two factories, factory 1 and factory 2. Factory 1 produces 20 allergy pills and 15 fever reducing pills per hour. Factory 2 produces 10 allergy pills and 30 fever reducing pills per hour.  Factory 1 is much more efficient and only requires 20 units of a rare compound while factory 2 requires 30 units of a rare compound. The company only has available 1000 units of the rare compound. If the company must make at least 700 allergy pills and 600 fever reducing pills, how many hours should each factory be run to minimize the total time needed?

Expected Output Schema:

Mathematical Formulation:
Sets:
- F: set of factories = {Factory1, Factory2}

Parameters:
- allergy_rate[f]: number of allergy pills produced per hour at factory f, with
  - allergy_rate[Factory1] = 20 pills/hour
  - allergy_rate[Factory2] = 10 pills/hour
- fever_rate[f]: number of fever reducing pills produced per hour at factory f, with
  - fever_rate[Factory1] = 15 pills/hour
  - fever_rate[Factory2] = 30 pills/hour
- compound_consumption[f]: units of the rare compound used per hour at factory f, with
  - compound_consumption[Factory1] = 20 units/hour
  - compound_consumption[Factory2] = 30 units/hour
- min_allergy: minimum required allergy pills = 700 pills
- min_fever: minimum required fever reducing pills = 600 pills
- max_compound: available units of rare compound = 1000 units

Variables:
- x[f]: operating hours for factory f (continuous nonnegative variable), where f ∈ F
  (x[Factory1] and x[Factory2])
- total_time: total operating time = x[Factory1] + x[Factory2] (continuous variable)

Objective:
- Minimize total_time = x[Factory1] + x[Factory2]
  (This represents the total hours required to run the factories.)

Constraints:
1. Allergy pills production constraint:
   20 * x[Factory1] + 10 * x[Factory2] ≥ 700
2. Fever reducing pills production constraint:
   15 * x[Factory1] + 30 * x[Factory2] ≥ 600
3. Rare compound availability constraint:
   20 * x[Factory1] + 30 * x[Factory2] ≤ 1000
4. Non-negativity constraints:
   x[Factory1] ≥ 0, x[Factory2] ≥ 0

----------------------------------------------------------
Model Comments:
- All production rates are given in pills per hour.
- Compound consumption rates are in units of the rare compound per hour.
- The objective minimizes the total operating hours across both factories.
- It is assumed that running a factory for one hour produces the stated quantities independently of the other factory.
- All units have been consistently applied according to the problem description.

Expected Output Schema Mapping:
{
  "variables": {
    "OperationalLevel": {
      "0": "x[Factory1] (hours)",
      "1": "x[Factory2] (hours)"
    },
    "MaxOperatingHours": "total_time (hours)"
  },
  "objective": "Minimize total_time = x[Factory1] + x[Factory2]"
}

Execution Results:
SUCCESS:
Solution for the Linear Programming Formulation:
------------------------------------------------
Factory1 Operating Hours (x[Factory1]): 33.33 hours
Factory2 Operating Hours (x[Factory2]): 3.33 hours
Total Operating Hours (MaxOperatingHours): 36.67 hours
Objective Value (Minimized Total Time): 36.67 hours


Expected Output:
