# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: A doctor's office takes the  temperature of patients one by one either by using an electronic or regular thermometer. The electronic thermometer takes 3 minutes to make a reading while the regular thermometer takes 2 minutes to make a reading. Since the electronic thermometer is more accurate, at least twice as many patients should have their temperature checked by the electronic thermometer than the regular thermometer. Since the electronic thermometer has a cooldown time, at least 50 patients should have their temperature checked by a regular thermometer. If the office is open for 15000 minutes, maximize the number of patients whose temperature can be taken?

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "ElectronicReadings": "float",
    "RegularReadings": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}'''

Mathematical Formulation:
Below is the structured mathematical model using the five-element framework.

--------------------------------------------------

Sets:
- T: set of thermometer types = {Electronic, Regular}

Parameters:
- time_electronic: time required for one electronic reading [minutes] = 3
- time_regular: time required for one regular reading [minutes] = 2
- total_available_time: total minutes the office is open [minutes] = 15000
- min_regular_readings: minimum number of regular readings [patients] = 50
- ratio_requirement: minimum ratio of electronic to regular readings [dimensionless] = 2  
  (Interpretation: The number of electronic readings must be at least twice the number of regular readings.)

Variables:
- ElectronicReadings (E): number of patients whose temperature is taken with the electronic thermometer [integer ≥ 0]
- RegularReadings (R): number of patients whose temperature is taken with the regular thermometer [integer ≥ 0]

Objective:
- Maximize TotalPatients = ElectronicReadings + RegularReadings

Constraints:
1. Time Constraint:  
   3 * ElectronicReadings + 2 * RegularReadings ≤ total_available_time  
   (Ensures that the sum of time spent on all readings does not exceed 15000 minutes.)

2. Ratio Constraint:  
   ElectronicReadings ≥ ratio_requirement * RegularReadings  
   (Ensures that there are at least twice as many electronic readings as regular readings.)

3. Minimum Regular Constraint:  
   RegularReadings ≥ min_regular_readings  
   (Ensures that at least 50 patients are checked with the regular thermometer.)

--------------------------------------------------

Additional Comments:
- All time parameters are in minutes, and the number of readings represents individual patients.
- While the decision variables are defined as integers since they represent patient counts, they can be modeled as continuous variables if rounding is applied.
- The objective is to maximize the total number of patients whose temperature is checked within the available time.

Execution Results:
SUCCESS:
----- Integer Model (Patients counted as integers) -----
ElectronicReadings: 3750.0
RegularReadings: 1875.0
Total Patients (Objective): 5625.0

----- Continuous Model (Relaxation) -----
ElectronicReadings: 3750.0
RegularReadings: 1875.0
Total Patients (Objective): 5625.0


Expected Output:
