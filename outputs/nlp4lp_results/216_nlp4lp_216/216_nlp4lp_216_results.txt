# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: A lighting company has access to two types of lights to provide their customers, an LED fixture, and a fluorescence lamp. The LED light uses 5 units of electricity per hour and needs to be changed 3 times a decade. Conversely, the fluorescence lamp uses 8 units of electricity per hour and needs to be changed 4 times a decade. Due to previous installations, at least 30% implemented lights must be fluorescence lamps. If the customer requires at least 300 light fixtures and can use at most 2000 units of electricity, how many of each light should be installed to reduce the total number of light changes?

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "NumFixtures": {
      "0": "float",
      "1": "float"
    },
    "NumFluorescenceFixtures": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}'''

Mathematical Formulation:
Below is one complete formulation of the problem using the five‐element structure. Note that because the description mixes “per hour” electricity data with a total available “units of electricity” budget and “fixture change frequencies per decade,” we assume for this model that the parameters apply over the same planning period (for example, one standardized period of usage where “electricity per hour” is interpreted as electricity consumption per fixture over that period). This assumption should be revisited if a more precise time‐scaling is available.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Sets:
- L: set of light types = {LED, Fluorescence}

----------------------------------------------------------------
Parameters:
- elec_usage[l]: electricity usage per light fixture of type l (in electricity units per period)
    • elec_usage[LED] = 5
    • elec_usage[Fluorescence] = 8
- changes_per_fixture[l]: number of light changes required per fixture in the planning period (e.g., per decade)
    • changes_per_fixture[LED] = 3
    • changes_per_fixture[Fluorescence] = 4
- min_total_fixtures: minimum total number of fixtures required
    • min_total_fixtures = 300
- max_electricity: maximum allowed total electricity usage (electricity units)
    • max_electricity = 2000
- min_fluorescence_ratio: minimum fraction of installed fixtures that must be Fluorescence lamps
    • min_fluorescence_ratio = 0.3

----------------------------------------------------------------
Variables:
- x[l]: number of light fixtures of type l to install (non-negative integer)
  (Specifically, x[LED] and x[Fluorescence] are decision variables.)

----------------------------------------------------------------
Objective:
Minimize total light changes across all fixtures
    Objective = changes_per_fixture[LED] * x[LED] + changes_per_fixture[Fluorescence] * x[Fluorescence]

----------------------------------------------------------------
Constraints:
1. Total Fixtures Constraint:
   x[LED] + x[Fluorescence] >= min_total_fixtures

2. Electricity Usage Constraint:
   elec_usage[LED] * x[LED] + elec_usage[Fluorescence] * x[Fluorescence] <= max_electricity

3. Fluorescence Requirement Constraint:
   x[Fluorescence] >= min_fluorescence_ratio * (x[LED] + x[Fluorescence])

----------------------------------------------------------------
Notes:
- Units: The electricity usage parameter is given in “units per period” and the change frequency is provided per decade. We assume both apply over the same planning horizon.
- Decision variables are assumed integer since one cannot install a fractional fixture.
- If a different time scaling is desired (e.g., converting “per hour” usage to total usage over a fixed number of operating hours), the parameters should be adjusted accordingly.
- The model seeks to minimize the total number of fixture changes under the specified constraints.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Expected Output Schema (example):
{
  "variables": {

      "LED": "integer",
      "Fluorescence": "integer"
    }
  },
  "objective": "Total light changes = 3 * x[LED] + 4 * x[Fluorescence]"
}
