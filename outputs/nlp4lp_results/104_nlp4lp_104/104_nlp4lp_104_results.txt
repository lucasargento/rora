# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: A patient takes anxiety medication and anti-depressants one after the other. Each unit of anxiety medication takes 3 minutes to be effective while each unit of anti-depressant takes 5 minutes to be effective. The patient must take at least 100 units of medication and at least 30 should be anxiety medication. Since the anxiety medication is strong, the patient can take at most twice the amount of anxiety medication as anti-depressants. How many units of each should the patient take to minimize the total time it take for the medication to be effective?

Expected Output Schema:

  "variables": {
    "AnxietyUnits": "float",

Mathematical Formulation:
Below is the structured mathematical model using the five-element framework.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Sets:
- MED: set of medication types = {Anxiety, Antidepressant}  
  (Note: Although the two medications can be handled separately, we list them here for clarity.)

Parameters:
- timeAnxiety = 3 (minutes per unit of anxiety medication)
- timeAntidepressant = 5 (minutes per unit of antidepressant medication)
- minTotalUnits = 100 (minimum total medication units required)
- minAnxietyUnits = 30 (minimum anxiety medication units required)
- maxAnxietyToAntidepressantRatio = 2 (anxiety medication units cannot exceed twice the number of antidepressant units)

Variables:
- AnxietyUnits: number of units of anxiety medication to take [float, units ≥ 0]
- AntidepressantUnits: number of units of antidepressant medication to take [float, units ≥ 0]

Objective:
- Minimize total medication effective time = (timeAnxiety * AnxietyUnits) + (timeAntidepressant * AntidepressantUnits)

Constraints:
1. Total medication requirement: AnxietyUnits + AntidepressantUnits ≥ minTotalUnits  
   (Ensure at least 100 units of medication are taken in total.)
2. Minimum anxiety medication: AnxietyUnits ≥ minAnxietyUnits  
   (Ensure at least 30 units of anxiety medication are taken.)
3. Ratio constraint for anxiety medication strength: AnxietyUnits ≤ maxAnxietyToAntidepressantRatio * AntidepressantUnits  
   (Since anxiety medication is stronger, it must be at most twice the number of antidepressant units.)

----------------------------------------------------------------

Comments:
- All time units are in minutes.
- The decision variables are defined as continuous values, though they represent "units." In practice, if only integer units are allowed, the variable type can be adjusted accordingly.
- The objective is to minimize the total effective time for the medication to work, assuming that the effects are additive.

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "AnxietyUnits": "float",
    "AntidepressantUnits": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}

Execution Results:

  Objective (Total Time): 366.6666666666667

Integer Model (Integer Variables):
  AnxietyUnits: 66.0
  AntidepressantUnits: 34.0
  Objective (Total Time): 368.0
