# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: A man  only eats vegetable and fruits. A serving of vegetables contains 2 units of vitamins and 3 units of minerals. A serving of fruit contains 4 units of vitamins and 1 unit of minerals. He wants to eat at least 20 units of vitamins and 30 units of minerals. If vegetables cost $3 per serving and fruits cost $5 per serving, how many servings of each should he eat to minimize his cost?

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "VegetableServings": "float",
    "FruitServings": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}'''

Mathematical Formulation:
Sets:
- FoodItems = {Vegetables, Fruits}

Parameters:
- vitamins_per_serving:
   - Vegetables: 2 (units of vitamins per serving)
   - Fruits: 4 (units of vitamins per serving)
- minerals_per_serving:
   - Vegetables: 3 (units of minerals per serving)
   - Fruits: 1 (units of minerals per serving)
- cost_per_serving:
   - Vegetables: 3 (USD per serving)
   - Fruits: 5 (USD per serving)
- required_vitamins: 20 (units)
- required_minerals: 30 (units)

Variables:
- VegetableServings: number of servings of vegetables to eat (continuous, ≥ 0)
- FruitServings: number of servings of fruits to eat (continuous, ≥ 0)

Objective:
- Minimize total cost = (3 * VegetableServings) + (5 * FruitServings)

Constraints:
1. Vitamin requirement constraint:
   (2 * VegetableServings) + (4 * FruitServings) ≥ 20
2. Mineral requirement constraint:
   (3 * VegetableServings) + (1 * FruitServings) ≥ 30

--------------------------------------------------

According to the expected output schema, the solution can be summarized as follows:
{
  "variables": {
    "VegetableServings": "float",
    "FruitServings": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}

Execution Results:
SUCCESS:
Optimal Solution (Linear Programming Model):
{'variables': {'VegetableServings': 10.0, 'FruitServings': 1.6062967656290216e-15}, 'objective': 30.000000000000007}


Expected Output:
Expected solution

: {'variables': {'VegetableServings': 10.0, 'FruitServings': 0.0}, 'objective': 30.0}
