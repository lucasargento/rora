Problem Name: 20_nlp4lp_20

# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: A car manufacturer makes two versions of the same car, a regular model and a premium model. They make x1 regular models per day and x2 premium models per day. The profit per regular model is $5000 and the profit per premium model is $8500 (x1 and x2 are unknown values both greater than or equal to 0). The daily demand for these cars is limited to and most 8 regular models and 6 premium models. In addition, the manufacturer can make a maximum of 12 cars of either type per day. How many cars of each model should the manufacturer make in order to maximize profit?

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "RegularModelsProduced": "float",
    "PremiumModelsProduced": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}'''

Mathematical Formulation:
Sets:
- M: set of car models = {Regular, Premium}

Parameters:
- profit_Regular: profit per regular model produced [USD per car] = 5000
- profit_Premium: profit per premium model produced [USD per car] = 8500
- max_demand_Regular: maximum daily demand for regular models [cars/day] = 8
- max_demand_Premium: maximum daily demand for premium models [cars/day] = 6
- max_total_production: maximum number of cars that can be produced per day, regardless of model [cars/day] = 12

Variables:
- RegularModelsProduced (x1): number of regular models produced per day [nonnegative integer or float; ideally integer]
- PremiumModelsProduced (x2): number of premium models produced per day [nonnegative integer or float; ideally integer]

Objective:
- Maximize total profit = (profit_Regular * RegularModelsProduced) + (profit_Premium * PremiumModelsProduced)

Constraints:
1. Demand constraint for regular models: RegularModelsProduced ≤ max_demand_Regular  
2. Demand constraint for premium models: PremiumModelsProduced ≤ max_demand_Premium  
3. Total production capacity constraint: RegularModelsProduced + PremiumModelsProduced ≤ max_total_production  
4. Non-negativity constraints: RegularModelsProduced ≥ 0, PremiumModelsProduced ≥ 0

The following JSON output uses the expected output schema:

{
  "variables": {
    "RegularModelsProduced": "float",
    "PremiumModelsProduced": "float"
  },
  "objective": "5000 * RegularModelsProduced + 8500 * PremiumModelsProduced"
}

Execution Results:
SUCCESS:
{
    "LinearProgrammingSolution": {
        "variables": {
            "RegularModelsProduced": 6.0,
            "PremiumModelsProduced": 6.0
        },
        "objective": 81000.0
    }
}


Expected Output:
