# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: A car manufacturer ships their cars on large and small planes. A large plane can carry 30 cars while a small plane can carry 10 cars. Since large planes cause more pollution, the number of large planes must be less than the number of small planes. If the manufacturer wants to deliver at least 300 cars, find the minimum number of planes that can be used.

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "NumLargePlanes": "float",
    "NumSmallPlanes": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}'''

Mathematical Formulation:
Sets:
- PlaneTypes = {Large, Small}

Parameters:
- capacity_Large = 30 (cars per large plane)
- capacity_Small = 10 (cars per small plane)
- minCars = 300 (minimum cars to deliver)

Variables:
- NumLargePlanes: integer, nonnegative (number of large planes)
- NumSmallPlanes: integer, nonnegative (number of small planes)

Objective:
- Minimize total planes used = NumLargePlanes + NumSmallPlanes

Constraints:
1. Delivery Requirement: (capacity_Large * NumLargePlanes) + (capacity_Small * NumSmallPlanes) ≥ minCars
2. Pollution Constraint: NumLargePlanes < NumSmallPlanes 
   (This can be modeled as: NumLargePlanes ≤ NumSmallPlanes - 1, ensuring that the number of large planes is strictly less than the number of small planes.)

Execution Results:
SUCCESS:
Results:
{
  "variables": {
    "NumLargePlanes": 7.0,
    "NumSmallPlanes": 9.0
  },
  "objective": 16.0
