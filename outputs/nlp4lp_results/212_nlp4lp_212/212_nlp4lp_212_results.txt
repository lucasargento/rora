# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: A macro-counting fitness guru only eats salmon and eggs. Each bowl of salmon contains 300 calories, 15 grams of protein, and 80 mg of sodium. Each bowl of eggs contains 200 calories, 8 grams of protein, and 20 mg of sodium. Since the fitness guru has a limit to how many eggs he would like to eat, at most 40% of his meals can be eggs. The fitness guru needs to eat at least 2000 calories and 90 grams of protein. How many of each type of meal should he eat to minimize his sodium intake?

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "NumMealsPerFoodType": {
      "0": "float",
      "1": "float"
    }
  },
  "objective": "float"
}'''

Mathematical Formulation:
Sets:
- F: set of food types = {salmon, eggs}

Parameters:
- calories[f]: calories per bowl of food f
   • salmon: 300 calories per bowl
   • eggs: 200 calories per bowl
- protein[f]: protein (grams) per bowl of food f
   • salmon: 15 grams per bowl
   • eggs: 8 grams per bowl
- sodium[f]: sodium (mg) per bowl of food f
   • salmon: 80 mg per bowl
   • eggs: 20 mg per bowl
- min_calories: minimum required calories per day = 2000 calories
- min_protein: minimum required protein per day = 90 grams
- max_eggs_ratio: maximum fraction of meals that can be eggs = 0.4  
  (Note: This means eggs can be at most 40% of total meals)
  
Variables:
- x[f]: number of bowls of food f to consume [continuous, x[f] ≥ 0]
  • x[salmon]: number of salmon bowls
  • x[eggs]: number of eggs bowls

Objective:
- Minimize total sodium intake = (80 * x[salmon]) + (20 * x[eggs])  
  (Units: mg)

Constraints:
1. Calorie constraint: (300 * x[salmon]) + (200 * x[eggs]) ≥ 2000
2. Protein constraint: (15 * x[salmon]) + (8 * x[eggs]) ≥ 90
3. Egg meal ratio constraint:
   Since at most 40% of the meals can be eggs, we have 
   x[eggs] ≤ 0.4 * (x[salmon] + x[eggs])
   This can be rearranged to: x[eggs] ≤ (2/3) * x[salmon]
4. Non-negativity: x[salmon] ≥ 0 and x[eggs] ≥ 0

Comments:
- The egg ratio constraint was algebraically rearranged from 
  x[eggs] ≤ 0.4 * (x[salmon] + x[eggs]) to avoid nonlinearity.
- While bowls are countable, we model the decision variables as continuous (floats) per the expected output schema.

This complete five-element model faithfully translates the given real-world optimization problem.
