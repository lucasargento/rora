Problem Name: 80_nlp4lp_80

# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: A patient in the hospital can take two pills, Pill 1 and Pill 2. Per pill, pill 1 provides 0.2 units of pain medication and 0.3 units of anxiety medication. Per pill, pill 2 provides 0.6 units of pain medication and 0.2 units of anxiety medication. In addition, pill 1 causes 0.3 units of discharge while pill 2 causes 0.1 units of discharge. At most 6 units of pain medication can be provided and at least 3 units of anxiety medication must be provided. How many pills of each should the patient be given to minimize the total amount of discharge?

Expected Output Schema:

    "NumberOfPills": {
      "0": "float",
      "1": "float"
    }

Mathematical Formulation:
Sets:
- Pills: set of pill types = {1, 2}

Parameters:
- pain_per_pill: amount of pain medication provided per pill, with
  - For Pill 1: 0.2 [units/pill]
  - For Pill 2: 0.6 [units/pill]
- anxiety_per_pill: amount of anxiety medication provided per pill, with
  - For Pill 1: 0.3 [units/pill]
  - For Pill 2: 0.2 [units/pill]
- discharge_per_pill: amount of discharge caused per pill, with
  - For Pill 1: 0.3 [units/pill]
  - For Pill 2: 0.1 [units/pill]
- max_total_pain: maximum allowed total pain medication = 6 [units]
- min_total_anxiety: minimum required total anxiety medication = 3 [units]

Variables:
- x[i] for each pill i in Pills:
  - x[1]: number of Pill 1 to administer [continuous, x[1] ≥ 0]
  - x[2]: number of Pill 2 to administer [continuous, x[2] ≥ 0]

Objective:
- Minimize total discharge = (0.3 * x[1]) + (0.1 * x[2])

Constraints:
1. Pain Medication Constraint:
   - (0.2 * x[1]) + (0.6 * x[2]) ≤ 6
2. Anxiety Medication Constraint:
   - (0.3 * x[1]) + (0.2 * x[2]) ≥ 3
3. Non-negativity:
   - x[1] ≥ 0, x[2] ≥ 0

Comments:
- All units are consistent with the problem description (units of medication or discharge per pill).
- Although pills are naturally discrete, the decision variables are modeled as continuous (float) as specified in the expected output schema.
