# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: My grandma is required to take two medicines Z1 and D3 everyday. She needs to take at least 5 grams of Z1 and 10 grams of D3 everyday. These medicines are available in two pills named Zodiac and Sunny. One pill of Zodiac contains 1.3 grams of Z1 while one pill of Sunny contains 1.2 grams of Z1. On the other hand, one pill of Zodiac contains 1.5 grams of D3 and one pill of Sunny contains 5 grams of D3. The cost per pill of Zodiac is $1 and the cost per pill of Sunny is $3. Formulate a LP such that the medicine requirement can be fulfilled at the lowest cost.

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "QuantityZodiac": "float",
    "QuantitySunny": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}'''

Mathematical Formulation:
Sets:
- PILL: set of pill types = {Zodiac, Sunny}

Parameters:
- cost[p]: cost per pill for each pill type p, where cost[Zodiac] = 1 (USD per pill) and cost[Sunny] = 3 (USD per pill)
- Z1_content[p]: grams of medicine Z1 per pill of type p, where Z1_content[Zodiac] = 1.3 (grams per pill) and Z1_content[Sunny] = 1.2 (grams per pill)
- D3_content[p]: grams of medicine D3 per pill of type p, where D3_content[Zodiac] = 1.5 (grams per pill) and D3_content[Sunny] = 5 (grams per pill)
- min_Z1: minimum required grams of medicine Z1 per day, min_Z1 = 5 (grams)
- min_D3: minimum required grams of medicine D3 per day, min_D3 = 10 (grams)

Variables:
- Quantity[p]: number of pills of type p to take per day
  - In particular, define:
    - QuantityZodiac = Quantity[Zodiac] (decision variable for Zodiac pills, nonnegative integer)
    - QuantitySunny = Quantity[Sunny] (decision variable for Sunny pills, nonnegative integer)
  - (Note: Although pills are naturally integer, if a continuous relaxation is acceptable, these can be treated as nonnegative floats.)

Objective:
- Minimize Total_Cost = cost[Zodiac] * QuantityZodiac + cost[Sunny] * QuantitySunny
  (Minimization is in USD per day)

Constraints:
1. Z1 constraint: 1.3 * QuantityZodiac + 1.2 * QuantitySunny ≥ min_Z1  
   (This ensures at least 5 grams of medicine Z1 are taken)
2. D3 constraint: 1.5 * QuantityZodiac + 5 * QuantitySunny ≥ min_D3  
   (This ensures at least 10 grams of medicine D3 are taken)
3. Nonnegativity constraint: QuantityZodiac ≥ 0 and QuantitySunny ≥ 0
