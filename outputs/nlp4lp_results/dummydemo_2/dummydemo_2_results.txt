# Problem Description:
'''Minimize 3x + 2y subject to x + y >= 10, x >= 0, y >= 0'''

Mathematical Formulation:
Below is the structured mathematical model using the five-element framework:

--------------------------------------------------

Sets:
- V: set of decision variables, V = {x, y}

Parameters:
- cost_x: cost coefficient for variable x, cost_x = 3 (cost per unit, assumed in USD per unit)
- cost_y: cost coefficient for variable y, cost_y = 2 (cost per unit, assumed in USD per unit)
- min_total: minimum combined value required, min_total = 10 (unit: same units as x and y)

Variables:
- x: decision variable representing the quantity corresponding to cost coefficient 3 [continuous, x ≥ 0, unit count]
- y: decision variable representing the quantity corresponding to cost coefficient 2 [continuous, y ≥ 0, unit count]

Objective:
- Minimize total cost = cost_x * x + cost_y * y
  (That is, minimize 3 * x + 2 * y)

Constraints:
- Combined requirement constraint: x + y ≥ min_total  
  (This ensures that the sum of x and y is at least 10)

--------------------------------------------------

Comments:
- All numerical values are assumed to be in consistent units (e.g., units of product or activity count for x and y and USD for cost coefficients).
- x and y are modeled as continuous nonnegative decisions.
- No integer or binary restrictions are present in this problem.
- This model formulation is direct and should map readily to Python or OR-Tools code.
