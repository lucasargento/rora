# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: Super Shop sells cat paw snacks and gold shark snacks in bulk. It plans to sell them into two snack mix products. The first mix contains 20% cat paw snacks and 80% gold shark snacks. The second mix contains 35% cat paw snacks and 65% gold shark snacks. The store has on hand 20 kg of cat paw snacks and 50 kg of gold shark snacks. If the profit per kg of the first mix is $12 and the profit per kg of the second mix is $15, how many kg of each should be prepared to maximize profit?

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "Mix1": "float",
    "Mix2": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}'''

Mathematical Formulation:
Sets:
- Mixes = {Mix1, Mix2}

Parameters:
- profit_Mix1: profit per kg for Mix1 = 12 [USD/kg]
- profit_Mix2: profit per kg for Mix2 = 15 [USD/kg]
- catpaw_frac_Mix1: fraction of cat paw snacks in Mix1 = 0.20 [kg cat paw per kg mix]
- goldshark_frac_Mix1: fraction of gold shark snacks in Mix1 = 0.80 [kg gold shark per kg mix]
- catpaw_frac_Mix2: fraction of cat paw snacks in Mix2 = 0.35 [kg cat paw per kg mix]
- goldshark_frac_Mix2: fraction of gold shark snacks in Mix2 = 0.65 [kg gold shark per kg mix]
- catpaw_available: available cat paw snacks = 20 [kg]
- goldshark_available: available gold shark snacks = 50 [kg]

Variables:
- x_Mix1: kilograms of Mix1 to prepare (continuous, ≥ 0) [kg]
- x_Mix2: kilograms of Mix2 to prepare (continuous, ≥ 0) [kg]

Objective:
- Maximize total profit = (profit_Mix1 * x_Mix1) + (profit_Mix2 * x_Mix2)
  (This represents the total profit in USD.)

Constraints:
- Cat paw snack constraint:
  (catpaw_frac_Mix1 * x_Mix1) + (catpaw_frac_Mix2 * x_Mix2) ≤ catpaw_available
  (Ensures that the total kg of cat paw snacks used in both mixes does not exceed 20 kg.)
- Gold shark snack constraint:
  (goldshark_frac_Mix1 * x_Mix1) + (goldshark_frac_Mix2 * x_Mix2) ≤ goldshark_available
  (Ensures that the total kg of gold shark snacks used in both mixes does not exceed 50 kg.)
