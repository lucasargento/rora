# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: A scientist is conducting two experiments to produce electricity, experiment alpha and experiment beta. In experiment alpha, 3 units of metal and 5 units of acid are required to produce 8 units of electricity. In experiment beta, 5 units of metal and 4 units of acid are required to produced 10 units of electricity. The lab has 800 units of metal and 750 units of acid available. How many of each experiment should the scientist conduct to maximize the total amount of electricity produced?

Mathematical Formulation:
Sets:
- E: set of experiments = {alpha, beta}

Parameters:
- metal_usage: metal consumed per experiment, with metal_usage[alpha] = 3 (units/experiment), metal_usage[beta] = 5 (units/experiment)
- acid_usage: acid consumed per experiment, with acid_usage[alpha] = 5 (units/experiment), acid_usage[beta] = 4 (units/experiment)
- electricity: electricity produced per experiment, with electricity[alpha] = 8 (units/experiment), electricity[beta] = 10 (units/experiment)
- available_metal: total available metal = 800 (units)
- available_acid: total available acid = 750 (units)

Variables:
- x_e: number of experiments of type e to conduct, for e in E; where each x_e is a continuous variable with x_e ≥ 0
  (Interpretation: x_alpha and x_beta represent how many times experiments alpha and beta are conducted, respectively.)

Objective:
- Maximize total electricity production defined as:
  TotalElectricity = electricity[alpha] * x_alpha + electricity[beta] * x_beta

Constraints:
- Metal constraint: metal_usage[alpha] * x_alpha + metal_usage[beta] * x_beta ≤ available_metal  
  (i.e., 3*x_alpha + 5*x_beta ≤ 800)
- Acid constraint: acid_usage[alpha] * x_alpha + acid_usage[beta] * x_beta ≤ available_acid  
  (i.e., 5*x_alpha + 4*x_beta ≤ 750)

    }
