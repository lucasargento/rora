# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: A city employs seasonal and permanent snow removers. A seasonal snow remover works 6 hours per shift and gets paid $120. A permanent snow remover works 10 hours per shift and gets paid $250. Currently the city needs 300 hours of snow remover labor after a heavy snowfall. If the city has a budget of $6500, how many of each type of worker should be hired to minimize the total number of snow removers?

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "NumberSeasonal": "float",
    "NumberPermanent": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}'''

Mathematical Formulation:
Sets:
- W: set of worker types = {Seasonal, Permanent}

Parameters:
- HoursPerShift_Seasonal = 6 (hours per shift for a seasonal snow remover)
- HoursPerShift_Permanent = 10 (hours per shift for a permanent snow remover)
- CostPerShift_Seasonal = 120 (USD per seasonal snow remover shift)
- CostPerShift_Permanent = 250 (USD per permanent snow remover shift)
- RequiredLaborHours = 300 (total snow removal labor hours needed)
- TotalBudget = 6500 (USD available for payment)

Variables:
- NumberSeasonal: number of seasonal snow removers hired (float ≥ 0; in practice, an integer count)
- NumberPermanent: number of permanent snow removers hired (float ≥ 0; in practice, an integer count)

Objective:
- Minimize TotalWorkers = NumberSeasonal + NumberPermanent

Constraints:
1. Labor Hours Constraint: 
   HoursPerShift_Seasonal * NumberSeasonal + HoursPerShift_Permanent * NumberPermanent ≥ RequiredLaborHours
   (i.e., 6 * NumberSeasonal + 10 * NumberPermanent ≥ 300)

2. Budget Constraint:
   CostPerShift_Seasonal * NumberSeasonal + CostPerShift_Permanent * NumberPermanent ≤ TotalBudget
   (i.e., 120 * NumberSeasonal + 250 * NumberPermanent ≤ 6500)
