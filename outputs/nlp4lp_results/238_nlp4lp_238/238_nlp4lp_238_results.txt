# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: A biotechnology company has 35,000 units of antibiotics available which is important to the process of making a first-dose and second-dose of vaccines. The first-dose vaccine requires 30 units of antibiotics and 20 mg of gelatine whereas the second-dose vaccine requires 65 units of antibiotics and 60 mg of gelatine. Since the first-dose vaccine is required before the second-dose vaccine, there must be more first-dose than second-dose vaccines manufactured. However, at least 40 second-dose vaccines must be made. How many of each vaccine should be made to minimize the amount of gelatine used?

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "FirstDoseVaccines": "float",
    "SecondDoseVaccines": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}'''

Mathematical Formulation:
Sets:
- Vaccines = {FirstDose, SecondDose}

Parameters:
- antibiotic_total = 35000 (total available antibiotic units)
- antibiotic_per_first = 30 (antibiotic units required for one first-dose vaccine)
- gelatine_per_first = 20 (gelatine required in mg for one first-dose vaccine)
- antibiotic_per_second = 65 (antibiotic units required for one second-dose vaccine)
- gelatine_per_second = 60 (gelatine required in mg for one second-dose vaccine)
- min_second_dose = 40 (minimum number of second-dose vaccines to manufacture)
  [Note: All units are assumed consistent with the problem description]

Variables:
- FirstDoseVaccines: number of first-dose vaccines to produce (integer, ≥ 0)
- SecondDoseVaccines: number of second-dose vaccines to produce (integer, ≥ 0)

Objective:
- Minimize total gelatine used (in mg) = gelatine_per_first * FirstDoseVaccines + gelatine_per_second * SecondDoseVaccines

Constraints:
1. Antibiotic resource constraint:
   antibiotic_per_first * FirstDoseVaccines + antibiotic_per_second * SecondDoseVaccines ≤ antibiotic_total

2. Vaccine order requirement (more first-dose than second-dose):
   FirstDoseVaccines ≥ SecondDoseVaccines + 1

3. Minimum second-dose production requirement:
   SecondDoseVaccines ≥ min_second_dose

This structured model fully captures the given real-world problem and can be directly mapped into implementations using Python or OR-Tools.

Execution Results:
SUCCESS:
Results for Model 1:
FirstDoseVaccines = 41.0
SecondDoseVaccines = 40.0
Objective (Total gelatine used in mg) = 3220.0


Expected Output:
