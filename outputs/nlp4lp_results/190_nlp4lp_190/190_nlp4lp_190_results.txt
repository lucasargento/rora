# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: A taco stand sells regular tacos and deluxe tacos with extra meat. The stand makes x1 regular tacos at a profit of $2.50 each and x2 deluxe tacos at a profit of $3.55 each (x1 and x2 are unknown variables both greater than or equal to 0). There is a demand for at most 50 regular tacos and at most 40 deluxe tacos. The stand only has enough supplies to sell at most 70 tacos of either type. How many of each taco should the stand make to maximize profit?

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "RegularTacosProduced": "float",
    "DeluxeTacosProduced": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}'''

Mathematical Formulation:
Sets:
- Tacos: set of taco types = {Regular, Deluxe}

Parameters:
- profit_regular: profit per regular taco produced (USD per taco) = 2.50
- profit_deluxe: profit per deluxe taco produced (USD per taco) = 3.55
- max_regular: maximum demand for regular tacos (tacos) = 50
- max_deluxe: maximum demand for deluxe tacos (tacos) = 40
- total_supply: maximum total taco production (tacos) = 70

Variables:
- x_regular: number of regular tacos produced, continuous, x_regular ≥ 0
- x_deluxe: number of deluxe tacos produced, continuous, x_deluxe ≥ 0

Objective:
- Maximize total_profit = profit_regular * x_regular + profit_deluxe * x_deluxe

Constraints:
1. Regular taco demand constraint: x_regular ≤ max_regular
2. Deluxe taco demand constraint: x_deluxe ≤ max_deluxe
3. Total production constraint: x_regular + x_deluxe ≤ total_supply

-------------------------------------------------
Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "RegularTacosProduced": "float",   // corresponds to x_regular
    "DeluxeTacosProduced": "float"       // corresponds to x_deluxe
  },
  "objective": "float"                   // total_profit = 2.50 * RegularTacosProduced + 3.55 * DeluxeTacosProduced
}

Execution Results:
SUCCESS:
Optimization Results:

Model: LP_Model

  RegularTacosProduced: 30.0
  DeluxeTacosProduced: 40.0
Optimal objective value: 217.0
