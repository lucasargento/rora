# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: Both chemical A and chemical B need to be added to a mixer for making bread. One unit of chemical A takes 30 seconds to be effective while one unit of chemical B takes 45 seconds to be effective. Because chemical A can be dangerous, there has to be at most a third as much chemical A as chemical B in the mixer. If there has to be at least 300 units of chemical A in the mixer and at least 1500 units of total chemicals in the mixer, how many units of each should be added to minimize the total time it takes for the mixed bread to be ready?

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "QuantityChemicalA": "float",
    "QuantityChemicalB": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}'''

Mathematical Formulation:
Sets:
- Chem: set of chemicals = {A, B}

Parameters:
- time_per_unit_A: Time required for one unit of chemical A to be effective [seconds per unit] = 30
- time_per_unit_B: Time required for one unit of chemical B to be effective [seconds per unit] = 45
- safe_ratio: Maximum allowed ratio of chemical A to chemical B [unitless] = 1/3  
  (Interpretation: The quantity of chemical A must be at most one third of the quantity of chemical B.)
- min_A: Minimum required units of chemical A [units] = 300
- min_total: Minimum required total units of chemicals A and B [units] = 1500

Variables:
- QuantityChemicalA: Number of units of chemical A to add [continuous, ≥ 0, units]
- QuantityChemicalB: Number of units of chemical B to add [continuous, ≥ 0, units]

Objective:
- Minimize total_mixing_time = (time_per_unit_A * QuantityChemicalA) + (time_per_unit_B * QuantityChemicalB)
  [Total mixing time in seconds]

Constraints:
1. Safety constraint: QuantityChemicalA ≤ safe_ratio * QuantityChemicalB
   (Ensures that chemical A does not exceed one third the amount of chemical B.)
2. Minimum chemical A requirement: QuantityChemicalA ≥ min_A
3. Total chemical requirement: QuantityChemicalA + QuantityChemicalB ≥ min_total

Comments:
- All units are assumed to be consistent (units for chemicals, seconds for time).  
- The objective is to reduce the overall mixing time while respecting safety and minimum quantity constraints.  
- Both decision variables are modeled as continuous, but if the application requires discrete units, they could be redefined as integers.
