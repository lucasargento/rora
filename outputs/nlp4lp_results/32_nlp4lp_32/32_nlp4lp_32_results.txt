# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: John has a 300 acre berry farm on which to plant blueberries and raspberries. John has $10000 to spend on watering and 575 days worth of labor available. For each acre of blueberries, 6 days worth of labor and $22 in watering costs is required. For each acre of raspberries, 3 days worth of labor and $25 in watering costs is required. The profit per acre of blueberries is $56 and the profit per acre of raspberries is $75. Formulate an LP problem in order to maximize profit.

Expected Output Schema:

Mathematical Formulation:
Sets:
- B: set of berry types = {Blueberries, Raspberries}

Parameters:
- total_acres: total available farmland [acres] = 300
- total_watering_budget: total available watering funds [USD] = 10000
- total_labor_days: total available labor days [days] = 575
- water_cost[b] for b in B:
  - water_cost[Blueberries] = 22 [USD per acre]
  - water_cost[Raspberries] = 25 [USD per acre]
- labor_requirement[b] for b in B:
  - labor_requirement[Blueberries] = 6 [days per acre]
  - labor_requirement[Raspberries] = 3 [days per acre]
- profit[b] for b in B:
  - profit[Blueberries] = 56 [USD per acre]
  - profit[Raspberries] = 75 [USD per acre]

Variables:
- x[b] for b in B: acres planted with berry type b [continuous, with x[b] ≥ 0] 
  (Interpretation: number of acres allocated to each berry type)

Objective:
- Maximize total profit = profit[Blueberries] * x[Blueberries] + profit[Raspberries] * x[Raspberries]

Constraints:
1. Land constraint:
   - x[Blueberries] + x[Raspberries] ≤ total_acres
2. Watering cost constraint:
   - water_cost[Blueberries] * x[Blueberries] + water_cost[Raspberries] * x[Raspberries] ≤ total_watering_budget
3. Labor days constraint:
   - labor_requirement[Blueberries] * x[Blueberries] + labor_requirement[Raspberries] * x[Raspberries] ≤ total_labor_days

Comments:
- All monetary values are in US dollars.
- Acres can be assumed continuous unless integer acreage is required.
- The model assumes that planting an acre is the smallest decision unit.

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "Acreage": [
      "float"
    ]
  },
  "objective": "float"
}

Execution Results:
SUCCESS:

Model: LP_Model
Acres of Blueberries: 0.0
