Problem Name: 74_nlp4lp_74

# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: There are two chemical reactions, chemical reaction A and chemical reaction B. Chemical reaction A requires 5 units of rare inert gas and 6 units of treated water to produce 10 units of a rare compound. Chemical reaction B requires 7 units of rare inert gas and 3 units of treater water to produce 8 units of a rare compound. There are 1000 units of the rare inert gas and 800 units of treated water available in the lab. How many reactions of each type should be done to maximize the amount of rare compound produced?

Mathematical Formulation:
Sets:
- R: set of reaction types = {A, B}

Parameters:
- inert_gas_A: inert gas required for reaction A = 5 units per reaction [units/reaction]
- water_A: treated water required for reaction A = 6 units per reaction [units/reaction]
- compound_A: rare compound produced by reaction A = 10 units per reaction [units/reaction]
- inert_gas_B: inert gas required for reaction B = 7 units per reaction [units/reaction]
- water_B: treated water required for reaction B = 3 units per reaction [units/reaction]
- compound_B: rare compound produced by reaction B = 8 units per reaction [units/reaction]
- total_inert_gas: available inert gas = 1000 units [units]
- total_water: available treated water = 800 units [units]

Variables:
- x_A: number of times reaction A is performed [nonnegative continuous variable; if reactions must be discrete, integer variable]
- x_B: number of times reaction B is performed [nonnegative continuous variable; if reactions must be discrete, integer variable]

Objective:
- Maximize total_rare_compound = (compound_A * x_A) + (compound_B * x_B)
  (This represents the total units of rare compound produced.)

Constraints:
1. Inert gas availability:
   (inert_gas_A * x_A) + (inert_gas_B * x_B) ≤ total_inert_gas
   [i.e., 5*x_A + 7*x_B ≤ 1000]

2. Treated water availability:
   (water_A * x_A) + (water_B * x_B) ≤ total_water
   [i.e., 6*x_A + 3*x_B ≤ 800]

Comments:
- All parameters and variable units are assumed to be consistent with the problem statement.
- The decision variables (x_A and x_B) represent the number of each reaction type performed. They can be modeled as integers if each reaction must occur whole, or as continuous variables if fractional reactions are acceptable.
- This formulation uses a straightforward linear programming approach to maximize the rare compound output under the given resource constraints.
