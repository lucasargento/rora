# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: A boy needs to get enough magnesium and zinc in his diet by eating chewable gummies and taking pills. Each gummy contains 3 units of magnesium and 4 units of zinc. Each pill contains 2 units of magnesium and 5 units of zinc. The boy must take at least 10 pills. Since he prefers gummies more, he must eat at least 3 times the amount of gummies as pills. If the boy can consume at most 200 units of magnesium, how many of each should he eat to maximize his zinc intake?

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "NumberOfGummies": "float",
    "NumberOfPills": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"

Mathematical Formulation:
Sets:
- S: set of supplement types = {Gummy, Pill}

Parameters:
- mg_per_gummy: 3 (units of magnesium per gummy)
- zn_per_gummy: 4 (units of zinc per gummy)
- mg_per_pill: 2 (units of magnesium per pill)
- zn_per_pill: 5 (units of zinc per pill)
- max_mg: 200 (maximum units of magnesium that can be consumed)
- min_pills: 10 (minimum number of pills that must be taken)
- gummy_ratio: 3 (the number of gummies must be at least 3 times the number of pills)

Variables:
- NumberOfGummies: continuous nonnegative variable representing the number of chewable gummies consumed (units)
- NumberOfPills: continuous nonnegative variable representing the number of pills consumed (units)

Objective:
- Maximize total zinc intake = (zn_per_gummy * NumberOfGummies) + (zn_per_pill * NumberOfPills)
  That is: Maximize Z = 4 * NumberOfGummies + 5 * NumberOfPills

Constraints:
1. Magnesium constraint:
   - mg_per_gummy * NumberOfGummies + mg_per_pill * NumberOfPills ≤ max_mg
   - 3 * NumberOfGummies + 2 * NumberOfPills ≤ 200

2. Minimum pills constraint:
   - NumberOfPills ≥ min_pills
   - NumberOfPills ≥ 10

3. Gummies preference constraint (gummy consumption is at least 3 times pill consumption):
   - NumberOfGummies ≥ gummy_ratio * NumberOfPills
   - NumberOfGummies ≥ 3 * NumberOfPills

4. Non-negativity:
   - NumberOfGummies ≥ 0
   - NumberOfPills ≥ 0
