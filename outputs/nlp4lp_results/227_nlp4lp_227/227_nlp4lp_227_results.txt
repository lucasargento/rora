# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: Due to an accident, at least 550 locals must be moved across a lake. They can either be transported over the lake by a kayak or a motorboat. Kayaks can transport 4 people every trip and motorboats can transport 5 people every trip. Kayaks take 5 minutes per trip whereas motorboats take 3 minutes per trip. Due to the limited number of motorboats available to the locals, there can be at most 25 motorboat trips and at least 75% of the trips should be by kayak. How many of each transportation method should be used to minimize the total amount of time needed to transport all the locals?

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "KayakTrips": "float",
    "MotorboatTrips": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}'''

Mathematical Formulation:
Sets:
- T: set of transportation modes = {Kayak, Motorboat}

Parameters:
- PeoplePerKayak: number of people transported per kayak trip = 4 [people/trip]
- PeoplePerMotorboat: number of people transported per motorboat trip = 5 [people/trip]
- TimePerKayak: time taken per kayak trip = 5 [minutes/trip]
- TimePerMotorboat: time taken per motorboat trip = 3 [minutes/trip]
- MinimumLocals: total locals to be transported = 550 [people]
- MaxMotorboatTrips: maximum allowed motorboat trips = 25 [trips]
- MinKayakTripFraction: minimum fraction of trips that must be by kayak = 0.75 [fraction]

Variables:
- KayakTrips: number of kayak trips to operate (integer, nonnegative) [trips]
- MotorboatTrips: number of motorboat trips to operate (integer, nonnegative) [trips]

Objective:
- Minimize TotalTime = (TimePerKayak * KayakTrips) + (TimePerMotorboat * MotorboatTrips) [minutes]

Constraints:
1. Transportation Capacity Constraint:
   (PeoplePerKayak * KayakTrips) + (PeoplePerMotorboat * MotorboatTrips) >= MinimumLocals
   (Ensures that at least 550 locals are moved across the lake.)
2. Motorboat Availability Constraint:
   MotorboatTrips <= MaxMotorboatTrips
   (Due to the limited number of motorboats available.)
3. Kayak Trip Fraction Constraint:
   KayakTrips >= MinKayakTripFraction * (KayakTrips + MotorboatTrips)
   (Ensures that at least 75% of all trips are made by kayak.)

Comments:
- All time units are in minutes, capacities in people per trip, and trip counts are assumed to be integer values.
- The decision variables represent the number of trips to schedule for each transportation mode.
- The Kayak Trip Fraction Constraint can also be algebraically rearranged as KayakTrips >= 3 * MotorboatTrips.
  
This completes the structured mathematical model using the five-element framework.
