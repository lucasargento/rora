Problem Name: 133_nlp4lp_133

# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: An oil and gas company is sending their oil to the port using containers and trucks. A container can hold 30 units of oil while a truck can hold 40 units of oil. Due to government restrictions, the number of trucks used has to at most half the number of containers used. If at least 2000 units of oil need to be sent to the port and at least 15 containers need to be used, minimize the total number of containers and trucks needed.

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "NumContainers": "float",
    "NumTrucks": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}'''

Mathematical Formulation:
Below is the five‐element structured model for the oil and gas container and truck transportation problem.

--------------------------------------------------
Sets:
- V = {Containers, Trucks}  
  (Note: Although there are only two decision types, we list them to show that our decisions pertain to the two vehicle types.)

--------------------------------------------------
Parameters:
- container_capacity = 30   (units of oil per container)
- truck_capacity = 40       (units of oil per truck)
- min_oil = 2000            (minimum total oil to be transported, in oil units)
- min_containers = 15       (minimum number of containers required)
- max_truck_ratio = 0.5     (government restriction: the number of trucks must be at most half the number of containers)

--------------------------------------------------
Variables:
- NumContainers: Number of containers used (integer, ≥ 0) [units: container count]
- NumTrucks: Number of trucks used (integer, ≥ 0) [units: truck count]

--------------------------------------------------
Objective:
- Minimize Total_Vehicles = NumContainers + NumTrucks  
  (This represents the minimization of the total number of containers and trucks used.)

--------------------------------------------------
Constraints:
1. Oil Capacity Requirement:
   container_capacity * NumContainers + truck_capacity * NumTrucks ≥ min_oil  
   [The combined capacity of the containers and trucks must be at least 2000 units.]

2. Minimum Container Requirement:
   NumContainers ≥ min_containers  
   [At least 15 containers must be used.]

3. Truck-to-Container Ratio (Government Restriction):
   NumTrucks ≤ max_truck_ratio * NumContainers  
   [The number of trucks used must be no more than half the number of containers.]

--------------------------------------------------
Additional Comments:
- All parameters are assumed to be in consistent units (oil in "units" and vehicles as counts). 
- Although the expected output schema lists decision variables as floats, here the variables are defined as integers to reflect that the number of containers and trucks must be whole numbers.
  
--------------------------------------------------
Expected Output Schema Example for Reference:
{
  "variables": {
    "NumContainers": "float",
    "NumTrucks": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}

This complete and self-contained model can directly guide a working implementation in Python or OR-Tools.
