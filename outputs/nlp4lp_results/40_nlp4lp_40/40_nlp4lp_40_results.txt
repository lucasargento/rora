# Problem Description:
'''Problem description: There are two processes, process A and process B, to plate a coin with gold. Process A requires 3 units of gold, 2 wires, and can plate 5 coins. Process B requires 5 units of gold, 3 wires, and can plate 7 coins. There are 500 units of gold and 300 wires available. How many processes of each type should be run to maximize the total number of coins that can be plated?

Mathematical Formulation:
Sets:
- P: set of processes = {ProcessA, ProcessB}

Parameters:
- goldRequired[ProcessA] = 3 (units of gold per execution of ProcessA)
- wireRequired[ProcessA] = 2 (units of wires per execution of ProcessA)
- coinsProduced[ProcessA] = 5 (coins plated per execution of ProcessA)
- goldRequired[ProcessB] = 5 (units of gold per execution of ProcessB)
- wireRequired[ProcessB] = 3 (units of wires per execution of ProcessB)
- coinsProduced[ProcessB] = 7 (coins plated per execution of ProcessB)
- totalGoldAvailable = 500 (total units of gold available)
- totalWiresAvailable = 300 (total units of wires available)
  
Variables:
- ExecuteProcessA: number of times ProcessA is executed (nonnegative, float; can be later restricted to integer if required)
- ExecuteProcessB: number of times ProcessB is executed (nonnegative, float; can be later restricted to integer if required)

Objective:
- Maximize total number of coins plated, defined as:
  TotalCoins = (coinsProduced[ProcessA] * ExecuteProcessA) + (coinsProduced[ProcessB] * ExecuteProcessB)

Constraints:
1. Gold constraint:
   (goldRequired[ProcessA] * ExecuteProcessA) + (goldRequired[ProcessB] * ExecuteProcessB) <= totalGoldAvailable

2. Wire constraint:
   (wireRequired[ProcessA] * ExecuteProcessA) + (wireRequired[ProcessB] * ExecuteProcessB) <= totalWiresAvailable

Model Comments:
- All units are assumed consistent: gold in units, wires in units, coins as output quantity.
- The decision variables represent the number of times each process is executed. Although defined as float here, if the process executions must be whole numbers, they can be required to be integers.
- The objective function focuses solely on maximizing the total coins plated and does not consider any cost since none were provided.

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "ExecuteProcessA": "float",
    "ExecuteProcessB": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
