This formulation accurately models the production scheduling problem where the demand in each period must be met (through current production and possible inventory from previous periods), regular production is limited to M units per period, and overtime production is available at a higher cost. The objective is to minimize the sum of production and inventory holding costs over all periods while satisfying the demand exactly.
