Problem Name: 91_Department_Relocation_Optimization

Mathematical Formulation:
\[
\begin{array}{rcll}
\textbf{Sets and Parameters:}&&&\\[1mm]
\mathcal{K} &=& \{1,2,\dots, K\} & \text{(departments)}\\[1mm]
\mathcal{L} &=& \{1,2,\dots, L\} & \text{(cities, including London)}\\[1mm]
\text{Benefit}_{k\ell} &\in& \mathbb{R}  & \forall k\in \mathcal{K},\, \ell\in \mathcal{L} \quad\text{(benefit, in thousands of pounds, if department }k\text{ is located in city }\ell\text{)}\\[1mm]
\text{Communication}_{kj} &\in& \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}  & \forall k,j \in \mathcal{K} \quad\text{(communication requirement between departments }k\text{ and }j\text{)}\\[1mm]
\text{Cost}_{\ell m} &\in& \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}  & \forall \ell, m\in \mathcal{L} \quad\text{(unit communication cost between city } \ell \text{ and city } m\text{)}\\[3mm]
\textbf{Decision Variables:}&&&\\[1mm]
x_{k\ell} &\in& \{0,1\} & \forall k\in \mathcal{K},\, \ell\in \mathcal{L}, \quad\text{where } x_{k\ell} = 
\begin{cases}
1, & \text{if department } k \text{ is assigned to city } \ell,\\[1mm]
0, & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
\end{array}

\noindent The company wishes to choose the location for each department so as to minimize the overall yearly cost. This overall cost consists of the communication costs between departments (which depend on the cities where they are located) minus the benefits obtained from relocating a department.

\[
\begin{array}{rcl}
\textbf{Minimize} && Z = \sum_{k\in \mathcal{K}}\sum_{j\in \mathcal{K}} \sum_{\ell\in \mathcal{L}} \sum_{m\in \mathcal{L}} \text{Communication}_{kj} \cdot \text{Cost}_{\ell m}\, x_{k\ell}\, x_{jm} \; - \; \sum_{k\in \mathcal{K}}\sum_{\ell\in \mathcal{L}} \text{Benefit}_{k\ell}\, x_{k\ell}. \\[2mm]
\textbf{Subject to} &&&\\[1mm]
\text{(1) Assignment Constraint:} && \sum_{\ell\in \mathcal{L}} x_{k\ell} = 1, & \forall k \in \mathcal{K}, \\[2mm]
\text{(2) Capacity Constraint:} && \sum_{k\in \mathcal{K}} x_{k\ell} \le 3, & \forall \ell \in \mathcal{L}, \\[2mm]
&&&\\[1mm]
\textbf{Decision Variables:} && x_{k\ell} \in \{0,1\}, & \forall k \in \mathcal{K}, \; \forall \ell \in \mathcal{L}.

\noindent A brief explanation of each component:

1. \textbf{Decision Variables:}  
   The binary variable \( x_{k\ell} \) indicates whether department \( k \) is located in city \( \ell \) (including London).

2. \textbf{Objective Function:}  
   The objective is to minimize the overall cost which has two parts:
   - The first term,
     \[
     \sum_{k\in \mathcal{K}}\sum_{j\in \mathcal{K}} \sum_{\ell\in \mathcal{L}} \sum_{m\in \mathcal{L}} \text{Communication}_{kj} \cdot \text{Cost}_{\ell m}\, x_{k\ell}\, x_{jm},
     \]
     represents the communication cost incurred between every pair of departments \( (k,j) \) given the cost of communication between their cities.
   - The second term,
     \[
     - \sum_{k\in \mathcal{K}}\sum_{\ell\in \mathcal{L}} \text{Benefit}_{k\ell}\, x_{k\ell},
     \]
     subtracts the benefit (in thousands of pounds) obtained by relocating the departments (or keeping them in London where applicable).

3. \textbf{Constraints:}
   - The assignment constraint ensures that each department is assigned to exactly one city.
   - The capacity constraint guarantees that no city (including London) hosts more than three departments.

This complete and self‐contained mathematical formulation accurately represents the original real–world economic and business decision problem.
