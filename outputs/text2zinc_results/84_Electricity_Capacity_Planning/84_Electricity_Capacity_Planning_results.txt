\textbf{Explanation:}  
1. The decision variables, \( x_t^{coal} \) and \( x_t^{nuke} \), represent the new capacities installed in period \( t \) for coal and nuclear technologies, respectively.  
2. The objective is to minimize the total capital cost incurred over the planning horizon.  
3. The Demand Satisfaction constraint aggregates the capacity available from (i) the non-retired oil-fired plants, (ii) coal plants built in the last \(\text{CoalLife}\) years, and (iii) nuclear plants built in the last \(\text{NukeLife}\) years, ensuring that yearly demand is met.  
4. The Nuclear Capacity Limit constraint ensures that in any period, the cumulative active nuclear capacity does not exceed the maximum allowable nuclear capacity due to political and safety considerations.  

This complete formulation accurately models the energy capacity planning problem while accounting for capacity lifetimes, demand requirements, and political constraints.
