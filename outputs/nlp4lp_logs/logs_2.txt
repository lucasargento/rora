........................................................................................................................
--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Sets:
- K: set of keyboard types = {FullWeighted, SemiWeighted}

Parameters:
- price[FullWeighted] = 2800 (revenue per full-weighted keyboard produced in USD per unit)
- price[SemiWeighted] = 2400 (revenue per semi-weighted keyboard produced in USD per unit)
- chipsNeeded[FullWeighted] = 20 (oscillator chips required per full-weighted keyboard, chips per unit)
- chipsNeeded[SemiWeighted] = 15 (oscillator chips required per semi-weighted keyboard, chips per unit)
- totalChips = 3500 (total available oscillator chips per day, in chips)
- productionTimePerUnit = 1.2 (production time required per keyboard, in hours per unit; same for both types)
- totalProductionTime = 6 (total available production time per day, in hours)

Variables:
- QuantityFullWeighted: number of full-weighted keyboards to produce (continuous nonnegative variable, in units)
- QuantitySemiWeighted: number of semi-weighted keyboards to produce (continuous nonnegative variable, in units)

Objective:
- Maximize total revenue = price[FullWeighted] * QuantityFullWeighted + price[SemiWeighted] * QuantitySemiWeighted

Constraints:
1. Chip availability constraint:
   (chipsNeeded[FullWeighted] * QuantityFullWeighted) + (chipsNeeded[SemiWeighted] * QuantitySemiWeighted) ≤ totalChips
2. Production time constraint:
   productionTimePerUnit * (QuantityFullWeighted + QuantitySemiWeighted) ≤ totalProductionTime

Comments:
- It is assumed that fractional production quantities are acceptable (continuous decision variables). If only integer quantities are allowed, then the variables should be defined as integer ≥ 0.
- All time and chip units are consistent with the provided data (hours for production time, chips for chip usage, USD for revenue).
- The objective function considers only revenue since no costs are given.

    "QuantityFullWeighted": "float",

........................................................................................................................
--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Sets:
- F: set of factory types = {Medium, Small}

Parameters:
- production_per_factory:
    - Medium: 50 (toys produced per day)
    - Small: 35 (toys produced per day)
- operators_required:
    - Medium: 3 (operators needed per factory)
    - Small: 2 (operators needed per factory)
- min_toys: 250 (minimum number of toys required per day)
- available_operators: 16 (total operators available)

Variables:
- x, where:
    - x[Medium] is the number of medium factories (integer ≥ 0)
    - x[Small] is the number of small factories (integer ≥ 0)

Objective:
- Minimize the total number of factories, i.e., minimize x[Medium] + x[Small]

Constraints:
1. Production constraint:
   - 50 * x[Medium] + 35 * x[Small] ≥ 250 
     (ensuring the total toy production meets or exceeds the daily requirement)
2. Operator constraint:
   - 3 * x[Medium] + 2 * x[Small] ≤ 16 
     (ensuring the total number of operators required does not exceed availability)

--------------------------------------------------

Based on the expected output schema:

{
  "variables": {
    "NumberOfFactories": {
      "0": "float",   // corresponds to x[Medium]
      "1": "float"    // corresponds to x[Small]
    }
  },
  "objective": "float"   // represents x[Medium] + x[Small]
}

Notes:
- In practical implementation, the decision variables should be constrained to integer values.
- All units (toys/day for production, number of operators for staffing) are assumed consistent as specified in the problem description.

........................................................................................................................
--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Below is one complete formulation of the problem using the five‐element structure. Note that because the description mixes “per hour” electricity data with a total available “units of electricity” budget and “fixture change frequencies per decade,” we assume for this model that the parameters apply over the same planning period (for example, one standardized period of usage where “electricity per hour” is interpreted as electricity consumption per fixture over that period). This assumption should be revisited if a more precise time‐scaling is available.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Sets:
- L: set of light types = {LED, Fluorescence}

----------------------------------------------------------------
Parameters:
- elec_usage[l]: electricity usage per light fixture of type l (in electricity units per period)
    • elec_usage[LED] = 5
    • elec_usage[Fluorescence] = 8
- changes_per_fixture[l]: number of light changes required per fixture in the planning period (e.g., per decade)
    • changes_per_fixture[LED] = 3
    • changes_per_fixture[Fluorescence] = 4
- min_total_fixtures: minimum total number of fixtures required
    • min_total_fixtures = 300
- max_electricity: maximum allowed total electricity usage (electricity units)
    • max_electricity = 2000
- min_fluorescence_ratio: minimum fraction of installed fixtures that must be Fluorescence lamps
    • min_fluorescence_ratio = 0.3

----------------------------------------------------------------
Variables:
- x[l]: number of light fixtures of type l to install (non-negative integer)
  (Specifically, x[LED] and x[Fluorescence] are decision variables.)

----------------------------------------------------------------
Objective:
Minimize total light changes across all fixtures
    Objective = changes_per_fixture[LED] * x[LED] + changes_per_fixture[Fluorescence] * x[Fluorescence]

----------------------------------------------------------------
Constraints:
1. Total Fixtures Constraint:
   x[LED] + x[Fluorescence] >= min_total_fixtures

2. Electricity Usage Constraint:
   elec_usage[LED] * x[LED] + elec_usage[Fluorescence] * x[Fluorescence] <= max_electricity

3. Fluorescence Requirement Constraint:
   x[Fluorescence] >= min_fluorescence_ratio * (x[LED] + x[Fluorescence])

----------------------------------------------------------------
Notes:
- Units: The electricity usage parameter is given in “units per period” and the change frequency is provided per decade. We assume both apply over the same planning horizon.
- Decision variables are assumed integer since one cannot install a fractional fixture.
- If a different time scaling is desired (e.g., converting “per hour” usage to total usage over a fixed number of operating hours), the parameters should be adjusted accordingly.
- The model seeks to minimize the total number of fixture changes under the specified constraints.

........................................................................................................................
--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Sets:
- SoilType: the set of soil types = {subsoil, topsoil}

Parameters:
- waterSubsoil = 10 (water units required per bag of subsoil per day)
- waterTopsoil = 6 (water units required per bag of topsoil per day)
- maxTotalBags = 150 (maximum total number of bags available)
- minTopsoilBags = 10 (minimum number of topsoil bags required)
- topsoilFractionLimit = 0.30 (at most 30% of all bags can be topsoil)
  • Note: The constraint topsoilBags ≤ topsoilFractionLimit × (subsoilBags + topsoilBags) can be equivalently linearized as:
    0.7 × topsoilBags ≤ 0.3 × subsoilBags, or equivalently, 7 × topsoilBags ≤ 3 × subsoilBags.

Variables:
- subsoilBags: number of subsoil bags used [integer, ≥ 0]
- topsoilBags: number of topsoil bags used [integer, ≥ 0]

Objective:
- Minimize totalWater = waterSubsoil × subsoilBags + waterTopsoil × topsoilBags
  • That is, minimize totalWater = 10 × subsoilBags + 6 × topsoilBags

Constraints:
1. Total bags constraint: subsoilBags + topsoilBags ≤ maxTotalBags
2. Minimum topsoil constraint: topsoilBags ≥ minTopsoilBags
3. Topsoil proportion constraint: 7 × topsoilBags ≤ 3 × subsoilBags  
   • This linear formulation enforces that topsoilBags ≤ 0.30 × (subsoilBags + topsoilBags).

Notes:
- All units are consistent: water is measured in water units per day per bag, and bag counts are whole units.
- Both decision variables are defined as integers to reflect the discrete number of bags. 

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "SubsoilBags": "float",  // here representing an integer number (≥ 0)
    "TopsoilBags": "float"   // here representing an integer number (≥ 0)

- NumberOfMinibuses: integer ≥ 0 (number of minibuses used)

Objective:
- Minimize TotalPollution = (VanPollution * NumberOfVans) + (MinibusPollution * NumberOfMinibuses)

Constraints:
1. Kid Transportation Coverage:
   - (VanCapacity * NumberOfVans) + (MinibusCapacity * NumberOfMinibuses) ≥ MinimumKids
2. Limit on Number of Minibuses:
   - NumberOfMinibuses ≤ MaxMinibuses
3. Van Usage Exceeds Minibus Usage:
   - NumberOfVans ≥ NumberOfMinibuses + 1
   
Note:
- The constraint "NumberOfVans ≥ NumberOfMinibuses + 1" replaces the strict inequality "NumberOfVans > NumberOfMinibuses" to ensure integer variable feasibility.
- All pollution and capacity parameters are assumed to be in consistent units (per vehicle).

Variables:
- BeamBridges: integer, number of beam bridges built (≥ 0) [units: bridges]
- TrussBridges: integer, number of truss bridges built (≥ 0) [units: bridges]

Objective:
- Maximize TotalMassSupported = (capacity_beam * BeamBridges) + (capacity_truss * TrussBridges)
  // This represents the sum of the supported masses by all built bridges (units: grams)

Constraints:
1. Popsicle Sticks Constraint:
   (sticks_per_beam * BeamBridges) + (sticks_per_truss * TrussBridges) ≤ max_sticks
2. Glue Constraint:
   (glue_per_beam * BeamBridges) + (glue_per_truss * TrussBridges) ≤ max_glue
3. Maximum Truss Bridges Constraint:
   TrussBridges ≤ max_truss_bridges
4. Relative Count Constraint:
   BeamBridges ≥ TrussBridges + 1
   // Ensures that the number of beam bridges is strictly larger than the number of truss bridges

Comments:
- All parameters are assumed to be in consistent units as given in the problem.
- The decision variables are modeled as integers since the number of bridges built must be whole numbers.
- The relative count constraint is written as BeamBridges ≥ TrussBridges + 1 to capture the strict inequality in an integer context.

Sets:
- P: set of products = {Refrigerator, Stove}

Parameters:
- profit_p: profit per unit of product p [USD per unit]
   - profit_Refrigerator = 400
   - profit_Stove = 260
- mover_time_p: mover time required per unit of product p [minutes per unit]
   - mover_time_Refrigerator = 60
   - mover_time_Stove = 45
- setup_time_p: setup time required per unit of product p [minutes per unit]
   - setup_time_Refrigerator = 20
   - setup_time_Stove = 25
- total_mover_time: total available mover time [minutes] = 20000
- total_setup_time: total available setup time [minutes] = 13000

Variables:
- x_p: number of units of product p to sell and install [integer, ≥ 0]
   - x_Refrigerator: number of refrigerators sold and installed
   - x_Stove: number of stoves sold and installed

Objective:
- Maximize total profit = profit_Refrigerator * x_Refrigerator + profit_Stove * x_Stove

Constraints:
- Mover time constraint: mover_time_Refrigerator * x_Refrigerator + mover_time_Stove * x_Stove ≤ total_mover_time
- Setup time constraint: setup_time_Refrigerator * x_Refrigerator + setup_time_Stove * x_Stove ≤ total_setup_time

Note:
- All time units are in minutes.
- Decision variables x_Refrigerator and x_Stove are assumed to be integer values because fractional appliances do not make sense in this context.

........................................................................................................................
--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Sets:
- AnimalTypes: set of animal types = {Camel, Horse}

Parameters:
- capacity[AnimalTypes]:
  • Camel: number of packages a camel can carry = 50 (packages per camel)
  • Horse: number of packages a horse can carry = 60 (packages per horse)
- foodRequirement[AnimalTypes]:
  • Camel: units of food required per camel = 20 (food units per camel)
  • Horse: units of food required per horse = 30 (food units per horse)
- requiredPackages: minimum number of packages to be delivered = 1000 (packages)
- availableFood: total available food = 450 (food units)

Variables:
- NumberOfCamels: number of camels to use, non-negative integer (units)
- NumberOfHorses: number of horses to use, non-negative integer (units)

Objective:
- Minimize total animals used = NumberOfCamels + NumberOfHorses

Constraints:
1. Package delivery constraint:
   50 * NumberOfCamels + 60 * NumberOfHorses >= requiredPackages  
   (Total delivered packages must be at least 1000.)

2. Food availability constraint:
   20 * NumberOfCamels + 30 * NumberOfHorses <= availableFood  
   (Total food required by animals must not exceed 450 food units.)

3. Horse climate suitability constraint:
   NumberOfHorses <= NumberOfCamels  
   (Due to horses being less suited for the hot climate, their number cannot exceed the number of camels.)

Comments:
- All units are consistent as stated (packages for capacity, food units for food requirements).
- Although animals are inherently integer, if required by solver, NumberOfCamels and NumberOfHorses should be defined as integer decision variables.

........................................................................................................................
--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Sets:
- Modes: set of transportation modes = {Ship, Plane}

Parameters:
- capacity_ship: containers carried per ship trip [40 containers per trip]
- capacity_plane: containers carried per plane trip [20 containers per trip]
- fuel_ship: fuel consumption per ship trip [500 liters per trip]
- fuel_plane: fuel consumption per plane trip [300 liters per trip]
- min_containers: minimum total containers to transport [500 containers]
- max_plane_trips: maximum number of plane trips [10 trips]
- min_ship_fraction: minimum fraction of total trips that must be by ship [0.5 (i.e., 50%)]

Variables:
- ShipTrips: number of ship trips [nonnegative integer or continuous if relaxable; units: trips]
- PlaneTrips: number of plane trips [nonnegative integer or continuous if relaxable; units: trips]

Objective:
- Minimize total fuel consumption, calculated as:
  Total_Fuel = fuel_ship * ShipTrips + fuel_plane * PlaneTrips

Constraints:
1. Container Transport Requirement:
   capacity_ship * ShipTrips + capacity_plane * PlaneTrips >= min_containers
2. Plane Trips Limit:
   PlaneTrips <= max_plane_trips
3. Minimum Ship Trip Proportion:
   ShipTrips >= min_ship_fraction * (ShipTrips + PlaneTrips)
   (This constraint can be simplified to ShipTrips >= PlaneTrips)

Comments:
- All units are consistent as containers, trips, and liters.
- The decision variables are typically integer; if fractional trips are allowed, relax integrality.
- The simplified interpretation of the minimum ship trip proportion is based on ShipTrips/(ShipTrips + PlaneTrips) >= 0.5, which implies ShipTrips >= PlaneTrips.

........................................................................................................................
--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Below is one clear formulation using the five-element structure.

────────────────────────────
Sets:
- Company: the set of annotation service providers = {Specialized, Common}

────────────────────────────
Parameters:
- specialized_rate = 60          (images per hour, rate at which the specialized company annotates)
- common_rate = 40               (images per hour, rate at which the common company annotates)
- cost_specialized = 100         (USD per hour for the specialized company)
- cost_common = 72               (USD per hour for the common company)
- min_images_total = 10000       (minimum total number of images to be annotated)
- specialized_min_frac = 1/3     (at least one-third of the total annotation work must be handled by the specialized company)

────────────────────────────
Variables:
- SpecializedHours: continuous nonnegative number of hours to be allocated to the specialized company
- CommonHours: continuous nonnegative number of hours to be allocated to the common company

────────────────────────────
Objective:
Minimize total cost = (cost_specialized * SpecializedHours) + (cost_common * CommonHours)
(This minimizes the overall payment in USD for the outsourced annotation work.)

────────────────────────────
Constraints:
1. Total image annotation constraint:
   (specialized_rate * SpecializedHours) + (common_rate * CommonHours) >= min_images_total
   (Ensures that at least 10,000 images are annotated.)
   
2. Specialized work fraction constraint:
   (specialized_rate * SpecializedHours) >= specialized_min_frac * [ (specialized_rate * SpecializedHours) + (common_rate * CommonHours) ]
   (Enforces that at least one-third of the annotated images are done by the specialized company.)
   
   Note: This constraint can be algebraically simplified. Multiplying both sides by 3 gives:
   3 * (specialized_rate * SpecializedHours) >= (specialized_rate * SpecializedHours) + (common_rate * CommonHours)
   For the given rates this is:
   3*60*SpecializedHours >= 60*SpecializedHours + 40*CommonHours  →  180*SpecializedHours >= 60*SpecializedHours + 40*CommonHours
   Subtracting 60*SpecializedHours from both sides:
   120*SpecializedHours >= 40*CommonHours  →  CommonHours <= 3 * SpecializedHours

────────────────────────────
For expected output to be used by the downstream agent, the following JSON is provided:

{
  "variables": {
    "SpecializedHours": "float, continuous >= 0",
    "CommonHours": "float, continuous >= 0"
  },
  "objective": "Minimize total cost = 100*SpecializedHours + 72*CommonHours (USD)"
}

────────────────────────────
Comments:
- The units are consistent: hours for decision variables, images per hour for annotation rates, and USD per hour for costs.
- The specialized work fraction has been modeled directly in terms of images annotated. The equivalent simplified constraint (CommonHours <= 3*SpecializedHours) is also valid.
- This formulation is faithful to the problem description and can be straightforwardly implemented in a typical optimization framework.

--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Below is the formulation of the problem using the five-element framework.

-----------------------------------------------------
Sets:
- E: set of equipment types = {basketball, football}

-----------------------------------------------------
Parameters:
- material_per_basketball = 5 units per basketball (material consumption per unit)
- material_per_football = 3 units per football (material consumption per unit)
- labor_per_basketball = 1 hour per basketball (labor consumption per unit)
- labor_per_football = 2 hours per football (labor consumption per unit)

- max_labor = 750 hours (total available worker hours)
- min_football = 50 (minimum number of footballs to produce)
- basketball_to_football_ratio = 3 (minimum factor such that number of basketballs is at least three times number of footballs)

-----------------------------------------------------
Variables:
- ProductionQuantityBasketballs: number of basketballs produced (non-negative integer)
- ProductionQuantityFootballs: number of footballs produced (non-negative integer)

For ease of notation, one can also define a helper vector variable:
- ProductionQuantity: where ProductionQuantity[0] = ProductionQuantityBasketballs and ProductionQuantity[1] = ProductionQuantityFootballs

-----------------------------------------------------
Objective:
Maximize total production of sports equipment, which is defined as:
TotalProduction = ProductionQuantityBasketballs + ProductionQuantityFootballs

-----------------------------------------------------
Constraints:
1. Material Constraint:
   5 * ProductionQuantityBasketballs + 3 * ProductionQuantityFootballs <= 1500
   (The total material used for both products must not exceed the 1500 available units.)

2. Labor Constraint:
   1 * ProductionQuantityBasketballs + 2 * ProductionQuantityFootballs <= 750
   (The total labor hours required for production cannot exceed the 750 available hours.)

3. Ratio Constraint (Basketball preference):
   ProductionQuantityBasketballs >= 3 * ProductionQuantityFootballs
   (At least three times as many basketballs must be produced as footballs.)

4. Minimum Football Production Constraint:
   ProductionQuantityFootballs >= 50
   (At least 50 footballs must be produced.)

-----------------------------------------------------

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "ProductionQuantity": {

      "1": "float"
    },
    "ProductionQuantityBasketballs": "float",
    "ProductionQuantityFootballs": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}

This completes the structured mathematical model for the manufacturing problem.

........................................................................................................................
--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Below is a five-element structured formulation of the problem. Note that pipes are assumed to be counted in whole numbers (integers). For simplicity, we assume all capacities and flows are stated in water units per minute.

--------------------------------------------------

Sets:
• (None required for this two-variable problem)

Parameters:
• WidePipeFlow = 25 (water units per minute delivered by one wide pipe)
• NarrowPipeFlow = 15 (water units per minute delivered by one narrow pipe)
• MinWaterFlow = 900 (minimum water flow required in water units per minute)
• MaxWidePipesRatio = 1/3 (the number of wide pipes can be at most one third of the number of narrow pipes)
• MinWidePipes = 5 (minimum number of wide pipes must be used)

Variables:
• WidePipes: an integer representing the number of wide pipes used (integer ≥ MinWidePipes)
• NarrowPipes: an integer representing the number of narrow pipes used (integer ≥ 0)

Objective:
• Minimize total number of pipes = WidePipes + NarrowPipes

Constraints:
1. Water Flow Constraint:
   • 25 * WidePipes + 15 * NarrowPipes ≥ 900
     (ensures that the total water delivered per minute meets the minimum requirement)

2. Pipe Ratio Constraint:
   • WidePipes ≤ (1/3) * NarrowPipes
     (ensures that the number of wide pipes is at most one third of the number of narrow pipes)

3. Minimum Wide Pipe Constraint:
   • WidePipes ≥ 5

--------------------------------------------------

This formulation fully captures the original problem. One can map these elements directly to a Python or OR-Tools implementation. 

For the expected output schema as a JSON object, here is a concise version:

{
  "variables": {
    "WidePipes": "integer, number of wide pipes (>= 5)",
    "NarrowPipes": "integer, number of narrow pipes (>= 0)"
  },
  "objective": "Minimize: WidePipes + NarrowPipes"
}

All parameters and units have been explicitly stated to ensure clarity and consistency with the problem data.

Upon review, the code correctly implements the structured formulation:

1. Decision variables (WidePipes and NarrowPipes) are integer with appropriate lower bounds.
2. The water flow constraint (25×WidePipes + 15×NarrowPipes ≥ 900) is correctly implemented.
3. The pipe ratio constraint is correctly transformed (using 3×WidePipes ≤ NarrowPipes) to avoid fractions.
4. The objective function is correctly set to minimize the total number of pipes (WidePipes + NarrowPipes).
5. Both the linear (SCIP) and CP-SAT implementations follow OR‑Tools best practices and appropriately add the constraints and objective.

No issues affecting correctness or performance were found.

Parameters:
- prep_time_e: preparation time required per experiment of type e [minutes]
  • in_vivo: 30
  • ex_vivo: 45
- exec_time_e: execution time required per experiment of type e [minutes]
  • in_vivo: 60
  • ex_vivo: 30
- radiation_e: radiation unit produced per experiment of type e [units]
  • in_vivo: 2
  • ex_vivo: 3
- max_prep_time: maximum available preparation time [minutes] = 400
- max_exec_time: maximum available execution time [minutes] = 500

Variables:
- x_e: number of experiments of type e to schedule [nonnegative real, ideally integer]
  • x_in_vivo corresponds to in_vivo experiments
  • x_ex_vivo corresponds to ex_vivo experiments

Objective:
- Minimize total radiation received, calculated as:
  Total Radiation = (radiation_in_vivo * x_in_vivo) + (radiation_ex_vivo * x_ex_vivo)
  Which numerically is: 2 * x_in_vivo + 3 * x_ex_vivo

Constraints:
1. Preparation time constraint:
   (prep_time_in_vivo * x_in_vivo) + (prep_time_ex_vivo * x_ex_vivo) ≤ max_prep_time
   That is: 30 * x_in_vivo + 45 * x_ex_vivo ≤ 400

2. Execution time constraint:
   (exec_time_in_vivo * x_in_vivo) + (exec_time_ex_vivo * x_ex_vivo) ≤ max_exec_time
   That is: 60 * x_in_vivo + 30 * x_ex_vivo ≤ 500

Comments:
- All time-related parameters are given in minutes.
- Decision variables represent the count of experiments and ideally should be integer values, though they are defined as nonnegative real numbers in this basic formulation.
- The objective is to minimize radiation exposure for the researcher while not exceeding the given preparation and execution time limits.

- MinLargeBones: minimum number of large bones to produce [bones] = 30
- MinSmallFraction: minimum fraction of small bones among all bones = 0.5  
  (This implies that the number of small bones must be at least equal to the number of large bones.)

Variables:
- SmallBones: number of small bones produced (nonnegative integer)
- LargeBones: number of large bones produced (nonnegative integer)

Objective:
- Minimize total meat usage = (MeatReq_Small * SmallBones) + (MeatReq_Large * LargeBones)

Constraints:
1. Tooth medication usage constraint:
   MedicationReq_Small * SmallBones + MedicationReq_Large * LargeBones <= MedicationStock
   → 10 * SmallBones + 15 * LargeBones <= 2000

2. Proportion constraint on bone types (at least 50% of bones are small):
   SmallBones >= (SmallBones + LargeBones) / 2
   This simplifies to: SmallBones >= LargeBones

3. Minimum large bone production:
   LargeBones >= MinLargeBones
   → LargeBones >= 30

4. Non-negativity:
   SmallBones >= 0  
   LargeBones >= 0

Additional Notes:
- All ingredients are measured in consistent "units".  
- The decision variables are assumed to be integers, since you cannot produce a fraction of a bone.
  
This completes the structured mathematical model for the given problem.

--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Sets:
- Products: {Scooter, Bike}

Parameters:
- profit: profit per unit, with profit[Scooter] = 200 (USD per scooter) and profit[Bike] = 300 (USD per bike)
- design_hours: design team hours required per unit, with design_hours[Scooter] = 2 (hours per scooter) and design_hours[Bike] = 4 (hours per bike)
- engineering_hours: engineering team hours required per unit, with engineering_hours[Scooter] = 3 (hours per scooter) and engineering_hours[Bike] = 5 (hours per bike)
- available_design_time: total available design team hours per month = 5000 (hours)
- available_engineering_time: total available engineering team hours per month = 6000 (hours)

Variables:
- x[product]: number of units produced of product (Scooter and Bike). These are non-negative decision variables. (They can be modeled as continuous or integer as required by implementation. Typically, production quantities are integer.)

Objective:
- Maximize total profit = profit[Scooter] * x[Scooter] + profit[Bike] * x[Bike]

Constraints:
1. Design time constraint: design_hours[Scooter] * x[Scooter] + design_hours[Bike] * x[Bike] ≤ available_design_time  
   (i.e., 2 * x[Scooter] + 4 * x[Bike] ≤ 5000)
2. Engineering time constraint: engineering_hours[Scooter] * x[Scooter] + engineering_hours[Bike] * x[Bike] ≤ available_engineering_time  
   (i.e., 3 * x[Scooter] + 5 * x[Bike] ≤ 6000)

Notes:
- All units are in hours for time-related parameters and in USD for profit.
- The decision variables represent monthly production quantities.

Sets:
- DeviceTypes: {Automatic, Manual}

Parameters:
- time_automatic: 10 (minutes per patient)
- time_manual: 15 (minutes per patient)
- total_available_time: 20000 (minutes)
- minimum_automatic_patients: 20 (patients)

- ManualPatients: number of patients measured with the manual machine (nonnegative continuous variable, units: patients)

Objective:
- Maximize total_patients = AutomaticPatients + ManualPatients

Constraints:
1. Time constraint: (time_automatic * AutomaticPatients) + (time_manual * ManualPatients) ≤ total_available_time  
   That is, 10 * AutomaticPatients + 15 * ManualPatients ≤ 20000

2. Machine reliability (ratio) constraint: ManualPatients ≥ manual_to_automatic_ratio * AutomaticPatients  
   That is, ManualPatients ≥ 2 * AutomaticPatients

3. Minimum automatic patients constraint: AutomaticPatients ≥ minimum_automatic_patients  
   That is, AutomaticPatients ≥ 20

Additional Notes:
- All time units are in minutes and patient counts are assumed to be represented as continuous values for modeling purposes (they can later be rounded or modeled as integers if needed).
- The objective is to maximize the number of patients processed within the available operating minutes.

}
........................................................................................................................
--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Sets:
- Modes: set of transportation modes = {Train, Tram}

Parameters:
- train_capacity: capacity per train [people per hour] = 120
- tram_capacity: capacity per tram [people per hour] = 30
- min_required_capacity: minimum total capacity required [people per hour] = 600

Variables:
- NumberOfTrains: number of trains to build [nonnegative integer] (can be modeled as float if relaxed)
- NumberOfTrams: number of trams to build [nonnegative integer] (can be modeled as float if relaxed)

Objective:
- Minimize total_units = NumberOfTrains + NumberOfTrams

Constraints:
1. Capacity Constraint: (train_capacity * NumberOfTrains) + (tram_capacity * NumberOfTrams) ≥ min_required_capacity  
   Meaning: 120 * NumberOfTrains + 30 * NumberOfTrams ≥ 600
2. Ratio Constraint: NumberOfTrams ≥ 2 * NumberOfTrains  
   Meaning: there are at least twice as many trams as trains

  "variables": {
    "NumberOfTrams": "float",
    "NumberOfTrains": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}

Comments:
- All units (people per hour) are consistent.
- Although the decision variables are naturally integers, they can be treated as floats in a relaxed model.
- The model minimizes the total number of units while ensuring the capacity and ratio constraints required for the transportation infrastructure are met.

........................................................................................................................
--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Below is the structured five‐element formulation for the problem.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Sets:
- V = {Bike, Scooter} 
  (the set of available electric vehicle types)

----------------------------------------------------------------
Parameters:
- meal_capacity_Bike = 8 meals per Bike  
- meal_capacity_Scooter = 5 meals per Scooter  
- charge_required_Bike = 3 charge units per Bike  
- charge_required_Scooter = 2 charge units per Scooter  
- total_charge = 200 charge units available  
- bike_percentage_limit = 0.30  
  (at most 30% of the total electric vehicles can be Bikes)  
- min_scooters = 20  
  (minimum number of Scooters to be used)

Note: The charge and capacity units for Bikes and Scooters are assumed consistent with the problem description.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Variables:
- x_Bike: number of Bikes to use [integer, ≥ 0]  
- x_Scooter: number of Scooters to use [integer, ≥ 0]

----------------------------------------------------------------
Objective:
Maximize Total Meals Delivered =  
   meal_capacity_Bike * x_Bike + meal_capacity_Scooter * x_Scooter  
which evaluates to:  
   8 * x_Bike + 5 * x_Scooter

----------------------------------------------------------------
Constraints:
1. Charging Constraint:
   charge_required_Bike * x_Bike + charge_required_Scooter * x_Scooter ≤ total_charge  
   That is, 3 * x_Bike + 2 * x_Scooter ≤ 200

2. Fleet Composition Constraint (30% limit on Bikes):
   x_Bike ≤ bike_percentage_limit * (x_Bike + x_Scooter)  
   In other words, the number of Bikes is at most 30% of the total vehicles.

3. Minimum Scooter Constraint:
   x_Scooter ≥ min_scooters  
   That is, x_Scooter ≥ 20

----------------------------------------------------------------

This formulation is fully self-contained and unambiguous.

........................................................................................................................
--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Sets:
- B: set of bag types = {Regular, Premium}

Parameters:
- cost[b]: cost per bag for bag type b [USD per bag], where cost[Regular] = 20 and cost[Premium] = 35.
- calcium[b]: calcium units per bag for bag type b [units per bag], where calcium[Regular] = 4 and calcium[Premium] = 12.
- vitamin[b]: vitamin mix units per bag for bag type b [units per bag], where vitamin[Regular] = 7 and vitamin[Premium] = 10.
- protein[b]: protein units per bag for bag type b [units per bag], where protein[Regular] = 10 and protein[Premium] = 16.
- req_calcium: minimum required calcium in the mix [units] = 15.
- req_vitamin: minimum required vitamin mix in the mix [units] = 20.
- req_protein: minimum required protein in the mix [units] = 20.

Variables:
- NumBags[b]: number of bags of type b to use in the mix. Decision variables are non-negative integers (or continuous if fractional bags are allowed, but typically integer) for each b in B.
  * For clarity, we denote:
    - NumRegularBags = NumBags[Regular]
    - NumPremiumBags = NumBags[Premium]

Objective:
- Minimize total cost = cost[Regular] * NumRegularBags + cost[Premium] * NumPremiumBags.
  Expressed as: minimize TotalCost = 20 * NumRegularBags + 35 * NumPremiumBags.

Constraints:
1. Calcium requirement: 4 * NumRegularBags + 12 * NumPremiumBags ≥ req_calcium (15 units)
2. Vitamin mix requirement: 7 * NumRegularBags + 10 * NumPremiumBags ≥ req_vitamin (20 units)
3. Protein requirement: 10 * NumRegularBags + 16 * NumPremiumBags ≥ req_protein (20 units)
4. Nonnegativity: NumRegularBags ≥ 0, NumPremiumBags ≥ 0  
   (Additionally, if integer decisions are required, then NumRegularBags and NumPremiumBags are integers.)

Comments:
- The parameters units are consistent: each bag contributes specified units of nutrients and costs dollars per bag.
- This formulation directly minimizes cost while ensuring that the total nutrient units in the mix meet the minimum health requirements.

........................................................................................................................
--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Below is the complete five-element structured mathematical model for the problem:

------------------------------------------------------------
Sets:
- F = {FeedA, FeedB} 
  (Each element in F represents a type of animal feed.)

Parameters:
- cost[FeedA] = 100 USD per kilogram  
- cost[FeedB] = 80 USD per kilogram  
- protein[FeedA] = 10 units protein per kilogram  
- protein[FeedB] = 7 units protein per kilogram  
- fat[FeedA] = 8 units fat per kilogram  
- fat[FeedB] = 15 units fat per kilogram  
- min_protein = 30 units (minimum required total protein)  
- min_fat = 50 units (minimum required total fat)  
  (All feed quantities are measured in kilograms. Protein and fat units are assumed to be consistent across feeds.)

Variables:
- QuantityFeedA: quantity of Feed A to use (continuous, in kilograms, QuantityFeedA ≥ 0)
- QuantityFeedB: quantity of Feed B to use (continuous, in kilograms, QuantityFeedB ≥ 0)

Objective:
- Minimize total cost = (cost[FeedA] * QuantityFeedA) + (cost[FeedB] * QuantityFeedB)
  (This represents the total expenditure in USD for the feed mixture.)

Constraints:
1. Protein requirement: (protein[FeedA] * QuantityFeedA) + (protein[FeedB] * QuantityFeedB) ≥ min_protein  
   (At least 30 units of protein must be present in the mixture.)

2. Fat requirement: (fat[FeedA] * QuantityFeedA) + (fat[FeedB] * QuantityFeedB) ≥ min_fat  
   (At least 50 units of fat must be present in the mixture.)

------------------------------------------------------------

Note:  
- The units across all parameters are consistent (USD per kilogram, units per kilogram, etc.).  
- No additional data has been assumed beyond what is specified.  
- This structure and variable naming are intended for a clear implementation in Python or OR-Tools.

The expected output schema corresponding to the model is:

{
  "variables": {
    "QuantityFeedA": "float",
    "QuantityFeedB": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"

--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Sets:
- Mixes: set of candy mixes = {RegularMix, SourSurpriseMix}

Parameters:
- profit[m]: profit per kilogram of mix m [USD per kg] where
  - profit[RegularMix] = 3
  - profit[SourSurpriseMix] = 5
- reg_requirement[m]: kilograms of regular candy required per kilogram of mix m [kg per kg] where
  - reg_requirement[RegularMix] = 0.8
  - reg_requirement[SourSurpriseMix] = 0.1
- sour_requirement[m]: kilograms of sour candy required per kilogram of mix m [kg per kg] where
  - sour_requirement[RegularMix] = 0.2
  - sour_requirement[SourSurpriseMix] = 0.9
- avail_reg: total available regular candy [kg] = 80
- avail_sour: total available sour candy [kg] = 60

Variables:
- x[m]: kilograms of mix m to produce [continuous, kg] for each m in Mixes, with x[m] ≥ 0

Objective:
- Maximize total profit = profit[RegularMix] * x[RegularMix] + profit[SourSurpriseMix] * x[SourSurpriseMix]

Constraints:
1. Regular candy availability: 
   reg_requirement[RegularMix] * x[RegularMix] + reg_requirement[SourSurpriseMix] * x[SourSurpriseMix] ≤ avail_reg
   (i.e., 0.8 * x[RegularMix] + 0.1 * x[SourSurpriseMix] ≤ 80)
2. Sour candy availability:
   sour_requirement[RegularMix] * x[RegularMix] + sour_requirement[SourSurpriseMix] * x[SourSurpriseMix] ≤ avail_sour
   (i.e., 0.2 * x[RegularMix] + 0.9 * x[SourSurpriseMix] ≤ 60)

Notes:
- All quantities are in kilograms.
- The decision variables x[m] are continuous, assuming fractional kilograms can be produced.
- This model assumes that all available candy is produced in the current period (i.e., no carryover stock effects).

Sets:
- SandwichTypes = {Light, Heavy}

Parameters:
- breadSlicesAvailable = 300               (total available bread slices)
- cheeseSlicesAvailable = 500              (total available cheese slices)
- breadPerLight = 2                        (bread slices needed per light sandwich)
- cheesePerLight = 3                       (cheese slices needed per light sandwich)
- breadPerHeavy = 3                        (bread slices needed per heavy sandwich)
- cheesePerHeavy = 5                       (cheese slices needed per heavy sandwich)
- timePerLight = 10                        (production time in minutes for a light sandwich)
- timePerHeavy = 15                        (production time in minutes for a heavy sandwich)
- minHeavyToLightRatio = 3                 (heavy sandwiches must be at least 3 times the light sandwiches)

Variables:
- LightSandwiches: continuous or integer ≥ 0    (number of light grilled cheese sandwiches to produce)
- HeavySandwiches: continuous or integer ≥ 0    (number of heavy grilled cheese sandwiches to produce)

Objective:
- Minimize totalProductionTime = (timePerLight * LightSandwiches) + (timePerHeavy * HeavySandwiches)
  (total production time in minutes)

Constraints:
1. Bread usage constraint:
   (breadPerLight * LightSandwiches) + (breadPerHeavy * HeavySandwiches) ≤ breadSlicesAvailable
   i.e., (2 * LightSandwiches) + (3 * HeavySandwiches) ≤ 300

2. Cheese usage constraint:
   (cheesePerLight * LightSandwiches) + (cheesePerHeavy * HeavySandwiches) ≤ cheeseSlicesAvailable
   i.e., (3 * LightSandwiches) + (5 * HeavySandwiches) ≤ 500

3. Sandwich ratio constraint:
   HeavySandwiches ≥ minHeavyToLightRatio * LightSandwiches
   i.e., HeavySandwiches ≥ 3 * LightSandwiches

Model Comments:
- All parameters are in consistent units (slices for ingredients, minutes for time).
- Although the expected schema defines the decision variables as floats, in practice, sandwich counts are typically integer values.
- The objective is to minimize the total production time while respecting the available quantities of bread and cheese and the required sandwich ratio.

This complete and structured model follows the five-element framework and accurately represents the original problem.

--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Sets:
- PILL_TYPE: set of pill types = {Large, Small}

Parameters:
- medicinal_available: total available medicinal ingredients = 1000 (units)
- req_med_large: medicinal ingredients required per large pill = 3 (units per pill)
- req_med_small: medicinal ingredients required per small pill = 2 (units per pill)
- req_fill_large: filler material required per large pill = 2 (units per pill)
- req_fill_small: filler material required per small pill = 1 (unit per pill)
- min_large: minimum number of large pills to produce = 100 (pills)
- small_fraction: minimum fraction of small pills among total pills = 0.60  
  (Note: This requirement is equivalent to enforcing small_pills ≥ 1.5 × large_pills)

Variables:
- PillsProduced[p] for p in PILL_TYPE, where:
  • PillsProduced[Large]: number of large pills to produce [integer ≥ 0]
  • PillsProduced[Small]: number of small pills to produce [integer ≥ 0]

Objective:
- Minimize total filler consumption = (req_fill_large × PillsProduced[Large]) + (req_fill_small × PillsProduced[Small])
  That is, minimize (2 × PillsProduced[Large] + 1 × PillsProduced[Small])

Constraints:
1. Medicinal ingredient availability:
   (req_med_large × PillsProduced[Large]) + (req_med_small × PillsProduced[Small]) ≤ medicinal_available
   i.e., 3 × PillsProduced[Large] + 2 × PillsProduced[Small] ≤ 1000

2. Minimum large pills production:
   PillsProduced[Large] ≥ min_large
   i.e., PillsProduced[Large] ≥ 100

3. Popularity requirement (at least 60% of pills must be small):
   This can be written as:
   PillsProduced[Small] ≥ small_fraction × (PillsProduced[Large] + PillsProduced[Small])
   Rearranging gives: PillsProduced[Small] ≥ 1.5 × PillsProduced[Large]

4. Non-negativity and integrality:
   PillsProduced[Large] and PillsProduced[Small] are integers and ≥ 0

----------------------
Mapping to the Expected Output Schema:

{
  "variables": {
    "PillsProduced": {
      "0": "float",   // corresponds to PillsProduced[Large]
      "1": "float"    // corresponds to PillsProduced[Small]
    }
  },
  "objective": "float"  // represents the total filler consumption: 2*PillsProduced[Large] + 1*PillsProduced[Small]"
}

Notes:
- Even though the expected JSON schema lists the decision variables as floats, the context (number of pills) implies ideally integer decisions. This can be adapted in implementation.
- All parameter units (ingredients per pill, overall available ingredients) are assumed to be consistent.

--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Sets:
- TransportModes: the set of delivery methods available = {Plane, Truck}

Parameters:
- plane_capacity: tires delivered per plane trip = 10 tires/trip
- truck_capacity: tires delivered per truck trip = 6 tires/trip
- plane_cost: cost per plane trip = 1000 dollars/trip
- truck_cost: cost per truck trip = 700 dollars/trip
- tire_requirement: minimum number of tires to transport = 200 tires
- available_budget: maximum spending available = 22000 dollars
- Note: All monetary units are in US dollars, capacities in number of tires, and trips are counted by number of trips.

Variables:
- PlaneTrips: number of cargo plane trips (continuous variable, but representable as integer in practice, measured in trips; units: trips)
- TruckTrips: number of ultrawide truck trips (continuous variable, but representable as integer in practice, measured in trips; units: trips)

Objective:
- Minimize total trips: TotalTrips = PlaneTrips + TruckTrips

Constraints:
1. Tire delivery requirement:
   - 10 * PlaneTrips + 6 * TruckTrips >= 200
   (The total number of tires delivered must be at least 200.)

2. Budget constraint:
   - 1000 * PlaneTrips + 700 * TruckTrips <= 22000
   (Total transportation cost cannot exceed 22000 dollars.)

3. Mode balance constraint:
   - PlaneTrips <= TruckTrips
   (Since many remote sites do not have proper airports, the number of plane trips is not allowed to exceed the number of truck trips.)

........................................................................................................................
--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Sets:
- F: set of fishing methods = {Net, Line}

Parameters:
- lake_area: total available lake area [acres] = 250
- fish_net: fish caught per acre using a net [fish/acre] = 8
- fish_line: fish caught per acre using a fishing line [fish/acre] = 5
- bait_net: bait required per acre using a net [units/acre] = 4
- bait_line: bait required per acre using a fishing line [units/acre] = 3
- pain_net: pain incurred per acre using a net [pain units/acre] = 2
- pain_line: pain incurred per acre using a fishing line [pain units/acre] = 1
- bait_available: total available bait [units] = 800
- pain_tolerance: maximum tolerable pain [pain units] = 350

Variables:
- AcresNet: acres of lake fished using the net [continuous, acres, ≥ 0]
- AcresLine: acres of lake fished using the fishing line [continuous, acres, ≥ 0]

Objective:
- Maximize total fish caught = (fish_net * AcresNet) + (fish_line * AcresLine)
  (i.e., Maximize 8 * AcresNet + 5 * AcresLine)

Constraints:
1. Lake area constraint:
   - AcresNet + AcresLine ≤ lake_area
   - (AcresNet + AcresLine ≤ 250 acres)
2. Bait availability constraint:
   - (bait_net * AcresNet) + (bait_line * AcresLine) ≤ bait_available
   - (4 * AcresNet + 3 * AcresLine ≤ 800 units)
3. Pain tolerance constraint:
   - (pain_net * AcresNet) + (pain_line * AcresLine) ≤ pain_tolerance
   - (2 * AcresNet + 1 * AcresLine ≤ 350 units)

Comments:
- All parameters are taken directly from the problem statement and units are consistent (acres for area, fish per acre, units of bait, and pain units).
- The decision variables are continuous since fractional acres can be considered.
- The objective is solely focused on maximizing the fish yield without mixing revenues and costs.

This completes the five-element structured mathematical model for the fishing problem.

........................................................................................................................
--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Below is the complete mathematical optimization model using the five-element structure.

--------------------------------------------------

Sets:
- T: set of tooth types = {Molars, Canines}

Parameters:
- resin_total = 3000 (total resin available, in resin units)
- resin_per_molar = 20 (resin required per molar, in resin units)
- resin_per_canine = 15 (resin required per canine, in resin units)
- painkiller_per_molar = 3 (pain killer required per molar, in pain killer units)
- painkiller_per_canine = 2.3 (pain killer required per canine, in pain killer units)
- min_molars = 45 (minimum number of molar fillings to schedule)
- min_canine_ratio = 0.6 (at least 60% of all cavities must be canines)

Variables:
- NumberMolars: number of molars to fill [float ≥ 0]
- NumberCanines: number of canines to fill [float ≥ 0]

Objective:
- Minimize total pain killer usage = (painkiller_per_molar * NumberMolars) + (painkiller_per_canine * NumberCanines)

Constraints:
1. Resin constraint:
   - resin_per_molar * NumberMolars + resin_per_canine * NumberCanines ≤ resin_total
   - (20 * NumberMolars) + (15 * NumberCanines) ≤ 3000

2. Canine ratio constraint (at least 60% of all filled teeth must be canines):
   - NumberCanines ≥ min_canine_ratio * (NumberMolars + NumberCanines)
   - This can be rearranged to: NumberCanines ≥ 1.5 * NumberMolars

3. Minimum molars constraint:
   - NumberMolars ≥ min_molars
   - NumberMolars ≥ 45

--------------------------------------------------

The expected output in the prescribed schema is:

{
  "variables": {
    "NumberMolars": "float",
    "NumberCanines": "float"
  },
  "objective": "minimize (3 * NumberMolars) + (2.3 * NumberCanines)"
}

Notes:
- The decision variables are defined as floats for ease of modeling. In practical scheduling, these may need to be integers.
- The unit of resin is assumed consistent across the parameters. Similarly, the pain killer units are assumed to be uniform.
- The canine ratio constraint has been reformulated from the statement “at least 60% of cavities filled must be in canines” to: NumberCanines ≥ 1.5 * NumberMolars.
- The structure above is self-contained and clear for straightforward translation into Python or OR-Tools code.

........................................................................................................................
--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Below is the structured mathematical model following the five-element framework. Note that the units for fat, calories, and cholesterol are taken directly from the problem (fat in “units”, calories in “calories”, and cholesterol in “units”), and the decision variables count the number of burgers and pizza slices (assumed to be nonnegative integers). We assume a person can only eat whole burgers and whole slices of pizza.

------------------------------------------------------------
Sets:
• FoodItems = {Burger, PizzaSlice}
  (This set labels the two types of items under consideration.)

------------------------------------------------------------
Parameters:
• BurgerFat = 10           (fat per burger in fat units)
• BurgerCalories = 300     (calories per burger)
• BurgerCholesterol = 12   (cholesterol per burger in cholesterol units)
• PizzaFat = 8             (fat per pizza slice in fat units)
• PizzaCalories = 250      (calories per pizza slice)
• PizzaCholesterol = 10    (cholesterol per pizza slice in cholesterol units)
• MinimumFat = 130         (required fat intake in fat units)
• MinimumCalories = 3000   (required caloric intake)
• PizzaMultiplier = 2      (pizza slices must be at least twice the number of burgers)

------------------------------------------------------------
Variables:
• x_Burger: number of burgers to eat [integer, ≥ 0, units = items]
• x_PizzaSlice: number of pizza slices to eat [integer, ≥ 0, units = items]

------------------------------------------------------------
Objective:
Minimize TotalCholesterol = (BurgerCholesterol * x_Burger) + (PizzaCholesterol * x_PizzaSlice)
   i.e., minimize 12 * x_Burger + 10 * x_PizzaSlice
(This objective minimizes the man's overall cholesterol intake.)

------------------------------------------------------------
Constraints:
1. Fat Constraint: (BurgerFat * x_Burger) + (PizzaFat * x_PizzaSlice) ≥ MinimumFat  
   i.e., 10 * x_Burger + 8 * x_PizzaSlice ≥ 130

2. Calorie Constraint: (BurgerCalories * x_Burger) + (PizzaCalories * x_PizzaSlice) ≥ MinimumCalories  
   i.e., 300 * x_Burger + 250 * x_PizzaSlice ≥ 3000

3. Pizza-to-Burger Ratio Constraint: The number of pizza slices must be at least twice the number of burgers  
   i.e., x_PizzaSlice ≥ PizzaMultiplier * x_Burger  
   (This ensures x_PizzaSlice ≥ 2 * x_Burger)

------------------------------------------------------------
Below is the expected output schema in JSON format:

{
  "variables": {
    "Burgers": "integer (≥0)",
    "PizzaSlices": "integer (≥0)"
  },
  "objective": "Minimize 12 * Burgers + 10 * PizzaSlices"
}

This model is complete, self-contained, and directly mappable to a working implementation in Python or OR-Tools.

- employees_large = 5        // Number of employees required for one large team [employees/team]
- lawn_small = 50            // Lawn area mowed by one small team [sq ft/team]
- lawn_large = 80            // Lawn area mowed by one large team [sq ft/team]
- total_employees = 150      // Total employees available [employees]
- min_small_teams = 10       // Minimum number of small teams required [teams]
- min_large_teams = 6        // Minimum number of large teams required [teams]
- ratio_small_to_large = 3   // The number of small teams must be at least 3 times the number of large teams

Variables:
- SmallTeams: integer, number of small teams to deploy [teams]
- LargeTeams: integer, number of large teams to deploy [teams]

Objective:
- Maximize Total Lawn Mowed = (lawn_small * SmallTeams) + (lawn_large * LargeTeams) 
  [square feet]

Constraints:
1. Employee Availability: 
   (employees_small * SmallTeams) + (employees_large * LargeTeams) <= total_employees

2. Ratio Constraint: 
   SmallTeams >= ratio_small_to_large * LargeTeams

3. Minimum Team Requirements: 
   SmallTeams >= min_small_teams
   LargeTeams >= min_large_teams

Comments:
- All units are consistent. Employees are counted per team, and the total lawn area is measured in square feet.
- Decision variables are modeled as integers because partial teams are not allowed.
- The model seeks to maximize the total lawn area that can be mowed under the given labor and team composition restrictions.

--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Sets:
- GAMES: set of game types = {Throwing, Climbing}

Parameters:
- customers_per_hour:
    - Throwing: 15 (customers per hour per throwing game)
    - Climbing: 8 (customers per hour per climbing game)
- prize_cost_per_hour:
    - Throwing: 2 (USD per hour per throwing game)
    - Climbing: 3 (USD per hour per climbing game)
- max_prize_budget: 100 (USD available per hour for prizes)
- min_climbing_games: 5 (minimum number of climbing games)
- throwing_to_climbing_ratio: 2 (there must be at least 2 throwing games per climbing game)

Variables:
- ThrowingGames: number of throwing games operated (integer, ≥ 0)
- ClimbingGames: number of climbing games operated (integer, ≥ 0)

Objective:
- Maximize total_customers = (15 * ThrowingGames) + (8 * ClimbingGames)
  (This represents the total number of customers attracted per hour.)

Constraints:
1. Prize budget constraint:
   (2 * ThrowingGames) + (3 * ClimbingGames) ≤ 100
   [Ensures the total prizes cost per hour does not exceed 100 USD.]

2. Ratio constraint:
   ThrowingGames ≥ 2 * ClimbingGames
   [Ensures that there are at least twice as many throwing games as climbing games.]

3. Minimum climbing games constraint:
   ClimbingGames ≥ 5
   [Ensures at least 5 climbing games are operated.]

Note:
- All parameters are expressed in units matching "per hour" for both customer attraction and prize cost.
- Decision variables are assumed to be integers because they represent the number of games.
- This model is self-contained and directly maps to many optimization solvers (e.g., Python’s OR-Tools).

Expected Output Schema:

  "variables": {
    "ThrowingGames": "integer",
    "ClimbingGames": "integer"

........................................................................................................................
--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Below is one valid formulation of the optimization problem using the five‐element framework. In this version the decision is how many units of sulfate and ginger to add, together with a binary variable (coded as a float in this schema) that indicates if sulfate is added before ginger. Note that although the processing times are additive in this sequential setting (so that order does not affect the sum 0.5×SulfateUnits + 0.75×GingerUnits), the production requirement “one must be added before the other” is included through the variable SulfateAddedFirst. (In an implementation you may treat SulfateAddedFirst as a binary decision variable: 1 if sulfate is added first and 0 otherwise.)

------------------------------------------------------------
Sets:
- Ingredients = {Sulfate, Ginger}

------------------------------------------------------------
Parameters (with assumed units):
- sulfate_time: processing time per unit of sulfate = 0.5 minutes per unit.
- ginger_time: processing time per unit of ginger = 0.75 minutes per unit.
- min_sulfate_units: minimum required units of sulfate = 100 units.
- total_required_units: total units of ingredients = 400 units.
- max_sulfate_multiplier: maximum allowed ratio between sulfate and ginger = 2 (i.e. SulfateUnits ≤ 2 × GingerUnits).

------------------------------------------------------------
Variables:
- SulfateUnits: number of units of sulfate to add (continuous, nonnegative) [units].
- GingerUnits: number of units of ginger to add (continuous, nonnegative) [units].
- SulfateAddedFirst: indicator variable (binary, but typed here as a float 0 or 1) where 1 means sulfate is added first and 0 means ginger is added first.

------------------------------------------------------------
Objective:
Minimize total effective time in minutes:
  minimize Objective = sulfate_time × SulfateUnits + ginger_time × GingerUnits
                       = 0.5 × SulfateUnits + 0.75 × GingerUnits

------------------------------------------------------------
Constraints:
1. Total units constraint:
   SulfateUnits + GingerUnits = total_required_units
   (SulfateUnits + GingerUnits = 400)

2. Minimum sulfate requirement:
   SulfateUnits ≥ min_sulfate_units
   (SulfateUnits ≥ 100)

3. Maximum sulfate-to-ginger ratio constraint:
   SulfateUnits ≤ max_sulfate_multiplier × GingerUnits
   (SulfateUnits ≤ 2 × GingerUnits)

4. (Implicit ordering requirement)
   The decision variable SulfateAddedFirst indicates the order (with no extra time difference in the model since effective times are simply additive). This variable can be used in implementation if additional order‐dependent logic is needed.
  
------------------------------------------------------------
Note:
- All units in the time parameters are in minutes per unit.
- Although the sequential addition implies that one ingredient is added before the other, the total effective time is treated as the sum of the individual times.
- In this structured model the variable SulfateAddedFirst serves only to record the chosen order per the real-world instruction.
  
------------------------------------------------------------
The formatted answer (compatible with the expected output schema) is:

{
  "variables": {
    "SulfateUnits": "float (>= 0, units)",
    "GingerUnits": "float (>= 0, units)",
    "SulfateAddedFirst": "float (0 or 1, where 1 indicates sulfate is added first)"
  },
  "objective": "0.5 * SulfateUnits + 0.75 * GingerUnits (minimize total effective time in minutes)"
}

This model is now complete and consistent with the given problem description.

- max_gas: total available units of gas = 80 [gas units]
- max_AutoElectric_units: maximum allowed number of automatic electric jacks (due to outlet limitations) = 14 [jacks]
  (Note: "less than 15" is interpreted as at most 14 units)

Variables:
- AutoElectricJacksUsed: number of automatic electric jacks to purchase [integer, ≥ 0]
- GasPoweredJacksUsed: number of gas-powered jacks to purchase [integer, ≥ 0]

Objective:
- Maximize total_cars_processed = (processing_rate_AutoElectric * AutoElectricJacksUsed) + (processing_rate_GasPowered * GasPoweredJacksUsed)
  [cars processed per hour]

Constraints:
1. Outlet constraint for automatic electric jacks:
   AutoElectricJacksUsed ≤ max_AutoElectric_units
2. Electricity availability constraint:

4. Non-negativity and integrality:
   AutoElectricJacksUsed, GasPoweredJacksUsed are integer and ≥ 0

This completes the structured mathematical model for the autobody shop problem.

--> Problem Description
Problem description: A hot dog company can build two types of butcher shops, a small shop and a large shop. A small shop can make 30 hot dogs per day and requires 2 workers. A large shop can make 70 hot dogs per day and requires 4 workers. The company must make at least 500 hot dogs per day but they only have available 30 workers. How many of each butcher shop should the company build to minimize the total number of butcher shops?

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "NumberOfSmallShops": "float",
    "NumberOfLargeShops": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}
........................................................................................................................
--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Sets:
- S: set of shop types = {Small, Large}

Parameters:
- hotDogs_per_day[Small] = 30 (hot dogs produced per day by a small shop)
- hotDogs_per_day[Large] = 70 (hot dogs produced per day by a large shop)
- workers_per_shop[Small] = 2 (workers required for a small shop)
- workers_per_shop[Large] = 4 (workers required for a large shop)
- min_hotDogs = 500 (minimum required hot dogs per day)
- available_workers = 30 (total available workers)

Variables:
- NumberOfSmallShops: integer ≥ 0 (number of small shops to build)
- NumberOfLargeShops: integer ≥ 0 (number of large shops to build)

Objective:
- Minimize total number of shops = NumberOfSmallShops + NumberOfLargeShops

Constraints:
1. Production Constraint: 
   30 * NumberOfSmallShops + 70 * NumberOfLargeShops ≥ min_hotDogs
2. Worker Constraint: 
   2 * NumberOfSmallShops + 4 * NumberOfLargeShops ≤ available_workers

Comments:
- All units are consistent (hot dogs/day, workers are counted per shop).
- The decision variables are integers since you cannot build a fraction of a shop.
- The model seeks to minimize the total number of shops while meeting daily hot dog production and labor availability requirements.

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "NumberOfSmallShops": "integer >= 0",
    "NumberOfLargeShops": "integer >= 0"
  },

--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Below is a complete five‐element formulation of the baby food serving problem, expressed in a clear and self-contained format.

------------------------------------------------------------
Sets:
- F: set of baby food flavors = {Apple, Carrot}

Parameters:
- fat_Apple = 2       // fat units per serving of apple-flavored baby food (units/serving)
- fat_Carrot = 4      // fat units per serving of carrot-flavored baby food (units/serving)
- folate_Apple = 5    // folate units per serving of apple-flavored baby food (units/serving)
- folate_Carrot = 3   // folate units per serving of carrot-flavored baby food (units/serving)
- folate_max = 100    // maximum allowed folate intake (units)
- ratio = 3           // baby must eat 3 times as many apple servings as carrot servings (unitless ratio)
- min_Carrot = 2      // minimum number of carrot servings (servings)

Variables:
- AppleServings: integer ≥ 0 
     // number of servings of apple-flavored baby food (servings)
- CarrotServings: integer ≥ 0 
     // number of servings of carrot-flavored baby food (servings)

Objective:
- Maximize TotalFat = fat_Apple * AppleServings + fat_Carrot * CarrotServings
     // This total fat intake is measured in fat units

Constraints:
1. Folate Constraint:
   folate_Apple * AppleServings + folate_Carrot * CarrotServings ≤ folate_max
   // Total folate from both foods must not exceed 100 units

2. Serving Ratio Constraint:
   AppleServings = ratio * CarrotServings
   // The baby must have three times as many apple servings as carrot servings

3. Minimum Carrot Servings:
   CarrotServings ≥ min_Carrot
   // The baby must consume at least 2 servings of carrot-flavored baby food

------------------------------------------------------------
Comments:
- All parameters’ units are consistent: servings yield known fat and folate units.
- Decision variables are defined as integers because servings are counted in whole numbers.
- This model maximizes the baby’s fat intake subject to the folate limit and the serving ratio preference.

Below is the answer in the expected JSON schema format (listing only the decision variables and the objective expression for reference):

{
  "variables": {
    "AppleServings": "integer ≥ 0",
    "CarrotServings": "integer ≥ 0"
  },
  "objective": "Maximize TotalFat = 2 * AppleServings + 4 * CarrotServings"
}

--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Sets:
- CART_TYPES: {Medium, Large}

Parameters:
- horses_required: a mapping of cart types to the number of horses needed per cart; specifically, horses_required[Medium] = 2 and horses_required[Large] = 4.
- capacity: a mapping of cart types to the kilograms (kg) of rice each cart can transport; specifically, capacity[Medium] = 30 and capacity[Large] = 70.
- total_horses: the total number of horses available = 60.
- medium_to_large_ratio: the factor relating medium carts to large carts = 3 (i.e., NumberMediumCarts = 3 * NumberLargeCarts).
- min_carts: a mapping that defines the minimum number of carts for each type; min_carts[Medium] = 5 and min_carts[Large] = 5.

Variables:
- NumberMediumCarts: integer variable representing the number of medium-sized carts used (units: carts).
- NumberLargeCarts: integer variable representing the number of large-sized carts used (units: carts).

Objective:
- Maximize the total amount of rice transported.
  This is computed as:
    TotalRiceTransported = (capacity[Medium] * NumberMediumCarts) + (capacity[Large] * NumberLargeCarts)

Constraints:
1. Horse Availability Constraint:
   - The total number of horses used by both cart types must not exceed total_horses.
   - Expressed as: (horses_required[Medium] * NumberMediumCarts) + (horses_required[Large] * NumberLargeCarts) <= total_horses

2. Cart Ratio Constraint:
   - The number of medium carts must equal three times the number of large carts.
   - Expressed as: NumberMediumCarts = medium_to_large_ratio * NumberLargeCarts

3. Minimum Cart Constraints:
   - Ensure there are at least the minimum required carts for each type.
   - Expressed as:
       NumberMediumCarts >= min_carts[Medium]
       NumberLargeCarts >= min_carts[Large]

--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Below is one precise formulation of the problem in the five‐element framework. In this model, we assume that the decision variables (number of smoothies to produce) may be treated as continuous values. (In a practical implementation they would likely be integers.) Note that the “more than” constraint is modeled by requiring the number of banana chocolate smoothies to be at least one unit in excess of the acai berry smoothies. An alternative formulation could relax this by allowing noninteger values and then enforcing a strict inequality by a small epsilon; here, we assume integer decisions so that BananaSmoothies ≥ AcaiSmoothies + 1.

──────────────────────────────
Sets:
- S = {SmoothieTypes} with S = {Acai, Banana}

──────────────────────────────
Parameters:
- acaiBerryPerAcai = 7    // units of acai berries required per acai berry smoothie [units/smoothie]
- waterPerAcai = 3        // units of water required per acai berry smoothie [units/smoothie]
- bananaPerBanana = 6     // units of banana chocolate required per banana chocolate smoothie [units/smoothie]
- waterPerBanana = 4      // units of water required per banana chocolate smoothie [units/smoothie]
- availableAcai = 3500      // total available acai berries [units]
- availableBanana = 3200    // total available banana chocolate [units]
- minAcaiFraction = 0.35  // minimum fraction of total smoothies that must be acai berry smoothies
- epsilon = 1             // minimum additional unit to enforce strict “more than” (banana smoothies > acai smoothies)

──────────────────────────────
Variables:
- AcaiSmoothies: number of acai berry smoothies to produce [nonnegative integer, units]
- BananaSmoothies: number of banana chocolate smoothies to produce [nonnegative integer, units]

──────────────────────────────
Objective:
Minimize total water used = (waterPerAcai * AcaiSmoothies) + (waterPerBanana * BananaSmoothies)
[Units: water units]

──────────────────────────────
Constraints:
1. Acai ingredient availability:
   acaiBerryPerAcai * AcaiSmoothies ≤ availableAcai
   (i.e., 7 * AcaiSmoothies ≤ 3500)

2. Banana chocolate ingredient availability:
   bananaPerBanana * BananaSmoothies ≤ availableBanana
   (i.e., 6 * BananaSmoothies ≤ 3200)

3. Production popularity constraint (“banana smoothies must be more than acai smoothies”):
   BananaSmoothies ≥ AcaiSmoothies + epsilon
   (i.e., BananaSmoothies ≥ AcaiSmoothies + 1)

4. Loyal customer base constraint (at least 35% of smoothies must be acai berry):
   AcaiSmoothies ≥ minAcaiFraction * (AcaiSmoothies + BananaSmoothies)
   (i.e., AcaiSmoothies ≥ 0.35 * (AcaiSmoothies + BananaSmoothies))

──────────────────────────────
Expected Output Schema:

  "variables": {
    "AcaiSmoothies": "float",
    "BananaSmoothies": "float"
  },

This model is complete, adheres to the data given, and is written with simple expressions so it can be easily implemented (for example, in Python using OR-Tools).

Sets:
- F: set of fruits = {Banana, Mango}

Parameters:
- banana_cal: calories per banana [80 calories/banana]
- banana_potassium: potassium per banana [20 grams/banana]
- banana_sugar: sugar per banana [10 grams/banana]
- mango_cal: calories per mango [100 calories/mango]
- mango_potassium: potassium per mango [15 grams/mango]
- mango_sugar: sugar per mango [8 grams/mango]
- min_calories: minimum total calories required [4000 calories]
- min_potassium: minimum total potassium required [150 grams]
- max_frac_mango: maximum fraction of mangoes in total fruits [0.33]

Variables:
- XBanana: number of bananas to feed the gorilla [continuous, nonnegative, units: bananas]
- XMango: number of mangoes to feed the gorilla [continuous, nonnegative, units: mangoes]

Objective:
- Minimize total sugar intake = banana_sugar * XBanana + mango_sugar * XMango  
  (i.e., minimize 10 * XBanana + 8 * XMango)

Constraints:
1. Calorie Constraint:
   - banana_cal * XBanana + mango_cal * XMango >= min_calories  
   (i.e., 80 * XBanana + 100 * XMango >= 4000)

2. Potassium Constraint:
   - banana_potassium * XBanana + mango_potassium * XMango >= min_potassium  
   (i.e., 20 * XBanana + 15 * XMango >= 150)

3. Fruit Preference (Mango Limit) Constraint:
   - XMango <= max_frac_mango * (XBanana + XMango)  
   (i.e., XMango <= 0.33 * (XBanana + XMango))
   
Notes:
- All parameter units are consistent with the description.
- The decision variables are modeled as continuous; if discrete fruit counts are required, the variables can be forced to integer.
- The constraint XMango <= 0.33*(XBanana+XMango) ensures that the number of mangoes does not exceed 33% of the total fruits.

........................................................................................................................
--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Below is the structured mathematical model using the five-element framework.

------------------------------------------------------------
Sets:
- F: set of food items = {Hamburger, ChickenWrap}

------------------------------------------------------------
Parameters:
- min_calories: minimum required calories per worker = 2200 [calories]
- min_protein: minimum required protein per worker = 50 [grams]
- min_carbs: minimum required carbohydrates per worker = 70 [grams]
- cost_Hamburger: cost per hamburger = 6.5 [USD per unit]
- cost_ChickenWrap: cost per chicken wrap = 4 [USD per unit]
- cal_Hamburger: calories per hamburger = 800 [calories per unit]
- cal_ChickenWrap: calories per chicken wrap = 450 [calories per unit]
- protein_Hamburger: protein per hamburger = 19 [grams per unit]
- protein_ChickenWrap: protein per chicken wrap = 12 [grams per unit]
- carbs_Hamburger: carbohydrates per hamburger = 20 [grams per unit]
- carbs_ChickenWrap: carbohydrates per chicken wrap = 10 [grams per unit]

------------------------------------------------------------
Variables:
- quantity_f: number of units of food item f to provide [units, assumed to be non-negative integers]
  where f in F. In particular:
    - x_Hamburger: number of hamburgers (x_Hamburger ≥ 0)
    - x_ChickenWrap: number of chicken wraps (x_ChickenWrap ≥ 0)

------------------------------------------------------------
Objective:
- Minimize total cost = (cost_Hamburger * x_Hamburger) + (cost_ChickenWrap * x_ChickenWrap)
  [USD]

------------------------------------------------------------
Constraints:
1. Calorie requirement: (cal_Hamburger * x_Hamburger) + (cal_ChickenWrap * x_ChickenWrap) ≥ min_calories
2. Protein requirement: (protein_Hamburger * x_Hamburger) + (protein_ChickenWrap * x_ChickenWrap) ≥ min_protein
3. Carbohydrate requirement: (carbs_Hamburger * x_Hamburger) + (carbs_ChickenWrap * x_ChickenWrap) ≥ min_carbs

------------------------------------------------------------
Additional Comments:
- Units are consistent: costs in USD per unit, nutritional values in calories or grams per unit.
- Although in practice counts of food items are integer, the decision variables are defined as non-negative integers; if a relaxation (continuous values) is needed, then integrality can be enforced later.
- This model aims at finding the minimum-cost combination of hamburgers and chicken wraps that meets the nutritional requirements for the workers.

  "variables": {
    "Quantity": {
      "Hamburger": "integer (≥ 0)",
      "ChickenWrap": "integer (≥ 0)"

--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Sets:
- F: set of food types = {salmon, eggs}

Parameters:
- calories[f]: calories per bowl of food f
   • salmon: 300 calories per bowl
   • eggs: 200 calories per bowl
- protein[f]: protein (grams) per bowl of food f
   • salmon: 15 grams per bowl
   • eggs: 8 grams per bowl
- sodium[f]: sodium (mg) per bowl of food f
   • salmon: 80 mg per bowl
   • eggs: 20 mg per bowl
- min_calories: minimum required calories per day = 2000 calories
- min_protein: minimum required protein per day = 90 grams
- max_eggs_ratio: maximum fraction of meals that can be eggs = 0.4  
  (Note: This means eggs can be at most 40% of total meals)
  
Variables:
- x[f]: number of bowls of food f to consume [continuous, x[f] ≥ 0]
  • x[salmon]: number of salmon bowls
  • x[eggs]: number of eggs bowls

Objective:
- Minimize total sodium intake = (80 * x[salmon]) + (20 * x[eggs])  
  (Units: mg)

Constraints:
1. Calorie constraint: (300 * x[salmon]) + (200 * x[eggs]) ≥ 2000
2. Protein constraint: (15 * x[salmon]) + (8 * x[eggs]) ≥ 90
3. Egg meal ratio constraint:
   Since at most 40% of the meals can be eggs, we have 
   x[eggs] ≤ 0.4 * (x[salmon] + x[eggs])
   This can be rearranged to: x[eggs] ≤ (2/3) * x[salmon]
4. Non-negativity: x[salmon] ≥ 0 and x[eggs] ≥ 0

Comments:
- The egg ratio constraint was algebraically rearranged from 
  x[eggs] ≤ 0.4 * (x[salmon] + x[eggs]) to avoid nonlinearity.
- While bowls are countable, we model the decision variables as continuous (floats) per the expected output schema.

This complete five-element model faithfully translates the given real-world optimization problem.

Below is the structured mathematical model using the five-element framework.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Sets:
- MED: set of medication types = {Anxiety, Antidepressant}  
  (Note: Although the two medications can be handled separately, we list them here for clarity.)

Parameters:
- timeAnxiety = 3 (minutes per unit of anxiety medication)
- timeAntidepressant = 5 (minutes per unit of antidepressant medication)
- minTotalUnits = 100 (minimum total medication units required)
- minAnxietyUnits = 30 (minimum anxiety medication units required)
- maxAnxietyToAntidepressantRatio = 2 (anxiety medication units cannot exceed twice the number of antidepressant units)

Variables:
- AnxietyUnits: number of units of anxiety medication to take [float, units ≥ 0]
- AntidepressantUnits: number of units of antidepressant medication to take [float, units ≥ 0]

Objective:
- Minimize total medication effective time = (timeAnxiety * AnxietyUnits) + (timeAntidepressant * AntidepressantUnits)

Constraints:
1. Total medication requirement: AnxietyUnits + AntidepressantUnits ≥ minTotalUnits  
   (Ensure at least 100 units of medication are taken in total.)
2. Minimum anxiety medication: AnxietyUnits ≥ minAnxietyUnits  
   (Ensure at least 30 units of anxiety medication are taken.)
3. Ratio constraint for anxiety medication strength: AnxietyUnits ≤ maxAnxietyToAntidepressantRatio * AntidepressantUnits  
   (Since anxiety medication is stronger, it must be at most twice the number of antidepressant units.)

----------------------------------------------------------------

Comments:
- All time units are in minutes.
- The decision variables are defined as continuous values, though they represent "units." In practice, if only integer units are allowed, the variable type can be adjusted accordingly.
- The objective is to minimize the total effective time for the medication to work, assuming that the effects are additive.

--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Sets:
- S: set of performer types = {Otter, Dolphin}

Parameters:
- tricks_per_otter = 3       [tricks per performance]
- treats_per_otter = 3       [total treats per otter performance]
- tricks_per_dolphin = 1      [tricks per performance]
- treats_per_dolphin = 5      [total treats per dolphin performance]
- min_dolphins = 10         [minimum number of dolphins required]
- treats_available = 200     [total available treats]
- max_otter_fraction = 0.30     [maximum fraction of performers that can be otters]

Variables:
- NumberOfOtters: number of otters to include in the show [continuous, nonnegative, ideally integer]
- NumberOfDolphins: number of dolphins to include in the show [continuous, nonnegative, ideally integer]

Objective:
- Maximize total_tricks = tricks_per_otter * NumberOfOtters + tricks_per_dolphin * NumberOfDolphins

Constraints:
1. Treats constraint: treats_per_otter * NumberOfOtters + treats_per_dolphin * NumberOfDolphins ≤ treats_available
2. Minimum dolphins constraint: NumberOfDolphins ≥ min_dolphins
3. Otter fraction constraint: NumberOfOtters ≤ max_otter_fraction * (NumberOfOtters + NumberOfDolphins)

Note:
- All treat and trick units are consistent with the problem statement.
- Although the variables are naturally integer values, they are modeled as continuous in this formulation. In an implementation, integrality restrictions might be added if needed.

........................................................................................................................
--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Below is one valid formulation using the five‐element framework. Note that in this formulation we represent separately the number of shifts that are “covered” (by hiring a teacher for that particular shift) and the number of teachers hired. We assume that a teacher may cover at most one shift during the summer (so the number of teachers hired must be at least the number of shifts that occur for that teacher type). All numeric values are in the units stated in the problem (hours, USD, teacher/shifts).

--------------------------------------------------------------
Sets:
• TeacherType = {Staff, Substitute}

--------------------------------------------------------------
Parameters:
• Hours_per_Shift(Staff) = 6     [hours per staff shift]
• Hours_per_Shift(Substitute) = 3  [hours per substitute shift]
• Cost_per_Shift(Staff) = 300   [USD per staff shift]
• Cost_per_Shift(Substitute) = 100  [USD per substitute shift]
• Required_Teaching_Hours = 1000  [total available teaching hours required for summer]
• Budget = 40000        [total available budget in USD]

--------------------------------------------------------------
Variables (all decision variables are assumed to be nonnegative; they may be defined as continuous but in an integer implementation they should be integers):
• NumStaffShifts: number of staff shifts assigned [number of shifts]
• NumSubstituteShifts: number of substitute shifts assigned [number of shifts]
• NumStaffTeachers: number of staff teachers hired [number of teachers]
• NumSubstituteTeachers: number of substitute teachers hired [number of teachers]

--------------------------------------------------------------
Objective:
• Minimize total teachers hired = NumStaffTeachers + NumSubstituteTeachers

--------------------------------------------------------------
Constraints:
1. Teaching Availability (Cover required hours):
  ( Hours_per_Shift(Staff) * NumStaffShifts ) + ( Hours_per_Shift(Substitute) * NumSubstituteShifts ) ≥ Required_Teaching_Hours
  i.e., 6 * NumStaffShifts + 3 * NumSubstituteShifts ≥ 1000

2. Budget Constraint:
  ( Cost_per_Shift(Staff) * NumStaffShifts ) + ( Cost_per_Shift(Substitute) * NumSubstituteShifts ) ≤ Budget
  i.e., 300 * NumStaffShifts + 100 * NumSubstituteShifts ≤ 40000

3. Teacher-to-Shift Assignment:
  Because each teacher can cover at most one shift in the summer term:
  – NumStaffTeachers ≥ NumStaffShifts
  – NumSubstituteTeachers ≥ NumSubstituteShifts

--------------------------------------------------------------
Comments:
• This model uses two sets of decision variables. The “shifts” (NumStaffShifts and NumSubstituteShifts) determine the total cost and total teaching hours provided. The “teachers” (NumStaffTeachers and NumSubstituteTeachers) count the number of individuals hired. Since each teacher covers one shift at most, we require that for each teacher type the number of teachers is at least as high as the number of shifts.
• All cost and hour parameters are used consistently with the problem statement.
• The objective of minimizing total teachers is equivalent to minimizing (NumStaffTeachers + NumSubstituteTeachers).

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "NumStaffShifts": "float",
    "NumSubstituteShifts": "float",
    "NumStaffTeachers": "float",
    "NumSubstituteTeachers": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}

This formulation is complete and faithful to the original problem while remaining clear and unambiguous for subsequent implementation in Python or OR-Tools.

--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Below is one valid formulation of the problem using the five‐element framework.

-----------------------------------------------------
Sets:
- BottleTypes = {Glass, Plastic}

-----------------------------------------------------
Parameters:
- glass_capacity = 500       // capacity of a glass bottle in ml
- plastic_capacity = 750     // capacity of a plastic bottle in ml
- total_water = 250000       // total available water in ml
- min_glass = 20             // minimum number of glass bottles required
- plastic_factor = 3         // plastic bottles must be at least 3 times the number of glass bottles

-----------------------------------------------------
Variables:
- GlassBottles: integer, number of glass bottles produced (units), GlassBottles ≥ 0
- PlasticBottles: integer, number of plastic bottles produced (units), PlasticBottles ≥ 0

-----------------------------------------------------
Objective:
- Maximize TotalBottles = GlassBottles + PlasticBottles
  (the goal is to maximize the total count of bottles produced)

-----------------------------------------------------
Constraints:
1. Water Constraint:
   500 * GlassBottles + 750 * PlasticBottles ≤ 250000
   (the total water used by the bottles cannot exceed the available 250000 ml)

2. Preference for Plastic Bottles:
   PlasticBottles ≥ 3 * GlassBottles
   (ensures that the number of plastic bottles is at least three times that of glass bottles)

3. Minimum Glass Bottles Constraint:
   GlassBottles ≥ 20
   (at least 20 glass bottles must be produced)
   
-----------------------------------------------------
Expected Output Schema (as JSON):
{
  "variables": {
    "PlasticBottles": "float",
    "GlassBottles": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}

Notes:
- Although the output schema labels the decision variables as float, in a real implementation the bottle counts should be modeled as integers because they represent discrete units.
- All water volumes are in ml, and the capacities are consistent with the available water amount.
- This model assumes that bottles are produced using all available water if possible, while respecting the customer preference and minimum production requirements.

------------------------------------------------------------
Parameters:
- production_Rural: number of phones produced per rural factory per day (100 phones/day)
- production_Urban: number of phones produced per urban factory per day (200 phones/day)
- managers_Rural: number of managers required per rural factory (8 managers)
- managers_Urban: number of managers required per urban factory (20 managers)
- available_managers: total number of managers available (260 managers)
- required_phones: minimum number of phones to be produced per day (3000 phones)

------------------------------------------------------------
Variables:
- x_Rural: number of rural factories to build (integer ≥ 0)
- x_Urban: number of urban factories to build (integer ≥ 0)

------------------------------------------------------------
Objective:
Minimize total factories built = x_Rural + x_Urban

------------------------------------------------------------
Constraints:
1. Production Constraint (phone requirement):
   production_Rural * x_Rural + production_Urban * x_Urban ≥ required_phones
   i.e., 100 * x_Rural + 200 * x_Urban ≥ 3000

2. Manager Constraint:
   managers_Rural * x_Rural + managers_Urban * x_Urban ≤ available_managers
   i.e., 8 * x_Rural + 20 * x_Urban ≤ 260

------------------------------------------------------------
Notes:
- All units are consistent (phones/day, managers, and factory counts).
- The decision variables are assumed to be integers since you cannot build a fractional factory.
- The objective is to minimize the number of factories while meeting production and manager constraints.

--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Sets:
- M: set of meal types = {CrabCake, LobsterRoll}

Parameters:
- vitaminA_per_CrabCake = 5 [units of vitamin A per crab cake]
- vitaminC_per_CrabCake = 7 [units of vitamin C per crab cake]
- vitaminA_per_LobsterRoll = 8 [units of vitamin A per lobster roll]
- vitaminC_per_LobsterRoll = 4 [units of vitamin C per lobster roll]
- unsatFat_per_CrabCake = 4 [units of unsaturated fat per crab cake]
- unsatFat_per_LobsterRoll = 6 [units of unsaturated fat per lobster roll]
- required_vitaminA = 80 [units of vitamin A]
- required_vitaminC = 100 [units of vitamin C]
- max_lobster_ratio = 0.4 [maximum fraction of meals that can be lobster rolls]

Variables:
- QuantityCrabCake, a decision variable representing the number of crab cakes to consume [continuous nonnegative, assumed to be integer if meals must be whole units]
- QuantityLobsterRoll, a decision variable representing the number of lobster rolls to consume [continuous nonnegative, assumed to be integer if meals must be whole units]

Objective:
- Minimize total unsaturated fat intake = (unsatFat_per_CrabCake * QuantityCrabCake) + (unsatFat_per_LobsterRoll * QuantityLobsterRoll)

Constraints:
1. Vitamin A requirement: (vitaminA_per_CrabCake * QuantityCrabCake) + (vitaminA_per_LobsterRoll * QuantityLobsterRoll) >= required_vitaminA
2. Vitamin C requirement: (vitaminC_per_CrabCake * QuantityCrabCake) + (vitaminC_per_LobsterRoll * QuantityLobsterRoll) >= required_vitaminC
3. Lobster roll meal ratio constraint: QuantityLobsterRoll <= max_lobster_ratio * (QuantityCrabCake + QuantityLobsterRoll)

Notes:
- All parameter units are consistent with the meal description.
- Decision variables may be modeled as integers if fractional meals are not allowed.
- This model minimizes the consumption of unsaturated fat while satisfying the nutritional constraints and the meal composition guideline.

........................................................................................................................
--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Sets:
- S: set of store types = {RetailStore, FactoryOutlet}

Parameters:
- customers_retail: number of customers a retail store attracts per day = 200 [customers/day]
- employees_retail: number of employees required per retail store = 6 [employees/store]
- customers_factory: number of customers a factory outlet attracts per day = 80 [customers/day]
- employees_factory: number of employees required per factory outlet = 4 [employees/store]
- min_customers: minimum number of customers required per day = 1200 [customers/day]
- available_employees: total employees available = 50 [employees]

Variables:
- NumberRetailStores: number of retail stores to open (integer, ≥ 0) [stores]
- NumberFactoryOutlets: number of factory outlets to open (integer, ≥ 0) [stores]

Objective:
- Minimize total number of open stores = NumberRetailStores + NumberFactoryOutlets

Constraints:
1. Customer Requirement: (customers_retail * NumberRetailStores) + (customers_factory * NumberFactoryOutlets) ≥ min_customers  
   i.e., 200 * NumberRetailStores + 80 * NumberFactoryOutlets ≥ 1200
2. Employee Availability: (employees_retail * NumberRetailStores) + (employees_factory * NumberFactoryOutlets) ≤ available_employees  
   i.e., 6 * NumberRetailStores + 4 * NumberFactoryOutlets ≤ 50

Comments:
- All parameter units are consistent: customer counts per day and employee counts.
- The decision variables should preferably be integers since partial stores are not meaningful.
- This model minimizes the total number of stores while ensuring at least 1200 daily customers are reached and employee usage does not exceed the 50 available employees.

........................................................................................................................
--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Below is the complete five‐element structured model for the dog school problem.

──────────────────────────────
Sets:
- DogTypes = {Labrador, GoldenRetriever}

──────────────────────────────
Parameters:
- deliver_capacity[d] (newspapers per service):
  • deliver_capacity[Labrador] = 7
  • deliver_capacity[GoldenRetriever] = 10
    (Each labrador delivers 7 newspapers; each golden retriever delivers 10.)
- treats_required[d] (small bone treats per service):
  • treats_required[Labrador] = 5
  • treats_required[GoldenRetriever] = 6
    (Each labrador requires 5 treats; each golden retriever requires 6 treats.)
- total_treats = 1500    (total small bone treats available)
- min_golden_retrievers = 50  (minimum number of golden retrievers to use)
- max_lab_fraction = 0.6   (At most 60% of all dogs can be labradors. Equivalently, labradors ≤ 60% of (labradors + golden retrievers).)

──────────────────────────────
Variables:
- x[d] for each d in DogTypes: Number of dogs of type d to be used
  • x[Labrador] = NumLabradors (nonnegative integer; number of labradors)
  • x[GoldenRetriever] = NumGoldenRetrievers (nonnegative integer; number of golden retrievers)
- NewspapersDelivered: Total number of newspapers delivered (continuous; computed as 7*x[Labrador] + 10*x[GoldenRetriever])
  • For clarity in implementations, one may define:
    ServicesDelivered[0] = 7 * x[Labrador]
    ServicesDelivered[1] = 10 * x[GoldenRetriever]

──────────────────────────────
Objective:
Maximize NewspapersDelivered = 7 * x[Labrador] + 10 * x[GoldenRetriever]
  (We seek the choice of dogs that maximizes the total number of newspapers delivered.)

──────────────────────────────
Constraints:
1. Treat Supply Constraint:
  5 * x[Labrador] + 6 * x[GoldenRetriever] ≤ 1500
  (The total treats consumed by all dogs cannot exceed the available 1500 treats.)

2. Minimum Golden Retriever Usage:
  x[GoldenRetriever] ≥ 50
  (At least 50 golden retrievers must be used.)

3. Labrador Fraction Constraint:
  x[Labrador] ≤ 0.6 * (x[Labrador] + x[GoldenRetriever])
   Alternatively, rearrange to:
   0.4 * x[Labrador] ≤ 0.6 * x[GoldenRetriever]
   or equivalently,
   x[Labrador] ≤ 1.5 * x[GoldenRetriever]
  (This ensures that labradors represent no more than 60% of the total dogs.)

──────────────────────────────
Expected Output Schema (Mapping for implementation):

{
  "variables": {
    "ServicesDelivered": {
      "0": "7 * NumLabradors (newspapers by labradors)",
      "1": "10 * NumGoldenRetrievers (newspapers by golden retrievers)"
    },
    "NumGoldenRetrievers": "x[GoldenRetriever] (nonnegative integer)",
    "NumLabradors": "x[Labrador] (nonnegative integer)"
  },
  "objective": "7 * NumLabradors + 10 * NumGoldenRetrievers (total newspapers delivered)"
}

──────────────────────────────
Notes:
- All variable counts (dogs) are assumed to be integer. If the implementation requires a continuous relaxation, then enforce non-negativity.
- The constraint expressing that no more than 60% of dogs are labradors is implemented either as 
  x[Labrador] ≤ 0.6 * (x[Labrador] + x[GoldenRetriever]) 
or equivalently as 
  x[Labrador] ≤ 1.5 * x[GoldenRetriever]. 
Both formulations capture the same requirement.
- Units for newspapers and treats are consistent with the problem description.

This model fully represents the real-world problem in a clear and structured manner for subsequent implementation.

How many of each drill should be used to minimize the total number of drills needed?

--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Below is a complete formulation of the problem using the five-element framework.

--------------------------------------------------
Sets:
- DrillType: {High, Low}
  (We distinguish between high intensity drills and low intensity drills.)

--------------------------------------------------
Parameters:
- gems_per_drill:
  • High = 50 gems per drill per day
  • Low = 30 gems per drill per day
- water_per_drill:
  • High = 50 water units per drill per day
  • Low = 20 water units per drill per day
- gem_target = 800 gems per day (total gems to be processed)
- water_available = 700 water units per day
- max_high_percentage = 0.4
  (At most 40% of the drills used can be high intensity.)
- min_low_drills = 10
  (At least 10 low intensity drills must be used.)
  
  // Note: All water and gem units are assumed to be measured per day.

--------------------------------------------------
Variables:
- HighDrills: integer ≥ 0
  (Number of high intensity drills to use)
- LowDrills: integer ≥ 0
  (Number of low intensity drills to use)

--------------------------------------------------
Objective:
- Minimize total_drills = HighDrills + LowDrills
  (We want to minimize the total number of drills deployed.)

--------------------------------------------------
Constraints:
1. Gem Processing Constraint:
   50 * HighDrills + 30 * LowDrills ≥ gem_target
   (Combined processing capacity must cover at least 800 gems.)

2. Water Usage Constraint:
   50 * HighDrills + 20 * LowDrills ≤ water_available
   (Combined water usage of all drills cannot exceed 700 units.)

3. High Drill Percentage Constraint:
   HighDrills ≤ max_high_percentage * (HighDrills + LowDrills)
   (No more than 40% of the total drills can be high intensity.)

4. Minimum Low Drills Constraint:
   LowDrills ≥ min_low_drills
   (There must be at least 10 low intensity drills.)

--------------------------------------------------
Model Comments:
- The decision variables are defined as integers because they represent counts of drills.
- The gem production and water usage parameters are given per day; therefore, the constraints ensure daily processing meets the gem target without exceeding the available water.
- The constraint on the percentage of high intensity drills is formulated relative to the total number of drills.
- The objective is simply to minimize the total number of drills needed while satisfying all production and resource requirements.

  },
  "objective": "float"
}
........................................................................................................................
--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Sets:
- T: set of transportation modes = {Kayak, Motorboat}

Parameters:
- PeoplePerKayak: number of people transported per kayak trip = 4 [people/trip]
- PeoplePerMotorboat: number of people transported per motorboat trip = 5 [people/trip]
- TimePerKayak: time taken per kayak trip = 5 [minutes/trip]
- TimePerMotorboat: time taken per motorboat trip = 3 [minutes/trip]
- MinimumLocals: total locals to be transported = 550 [people]
- MaxMotorboatTrips: maximum allowed motorboat trips = 25 [trips]
- MinKayakTripFraction: minimum fraction of trips that must be by kayak = 0.75 [fraction]

Variables:
- KayakTrips: number of kayak trips to operate (integer, nonnegative) [trips]
- MotorboatTrips: number of motorboat trips to operate (integer, nonnegative) [trips]

Objective:
- Minimize TotalTime = (TimePerKayak * KayakTrips) + (TimePerMotorboat * MotorboatTrips) [minutes]

Constraints:
1. Transportation Capacity Constraint:
   (PeoplePerKayak * KayakTrips) + (PeoplePerMotorboat * MotorboatTrips) >= MinimumLocals
   (Ensures that at least 550 locals are moved across the lake.)
2. Motorboat Availability Constraint:
   MotorboatTrips <= MaxMotorboatTrips
   (Due to the limited number of motorboats available.)
3. Kayak Trip Fraction Constraint:
   KayakTrips >= MinKayakTripFraction * (KayakTrips + MotorboatTrips)
   (Ensures that at least 75% of all trips are made by kayak.)

Comments:
- All time units are in minutes, capacities in people per trip, and trip counts are assumed to be integer values.
- The decision variables represent the number of trips to schedule for each transportation mode.
- The Kayak Trip Fraction Constraint can also be algebraically rearranged as KayakTrips >= 3 * MotorboatTrips.
  
This completes the structured mathematical model using the five-element framework.

........................................................................................................................
--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Below is one complete and faithful formulation of the problem using the five‐element framework.

--------------------------------------------------
Sets:
- P = {BH, Combo} 
  where BH represents the banana-haters package and Combo represents the combo package.

Parameters:
- available_apples = 10 (units of apples available in stock)
- available_bananas = 20 (units of bananas available in stock)
- available_grapes = 80 (units of grapes available in stock)
- For package "BH" (banana-haters package):
  - apples_BH = 6 (apples needed per package)
  - bananas_BH = 0 (bananas needed per package)
  - grapes_BH = 30 (grapes needed per package)
  - profit_BH = 6 (euros earned per package sold)
- For package "Combo" (combo package):
  - apples_Combo = 5 (apples needed per package)
  - bananas_Combo = 6 (bananas needed per package)
  - grapes_Combo = 20 (grapes needed per package)
  - profit_Combo = 7 (euros earned per package sold)

Variables:
- x_BH: Number of banana-haters packages produced (nonnegative integer)
- x_Combo: Number of combo packages produced (nonnegative integer)
  (Note: Integer decisions are assumed because packages cannot be fractional. If a continuous relaxation is desired, x_BH and x_Combo can be considered nonnegative continuous variables.)

Objective:
- Maximize total profit = profit_BH * x_BH + profit_Combo * x_Combo  
  In other words, maximize: 6 * x_BH + 7 * x_Combo  
  (Unit: euros)

Constraints:
1. Apples stock: 6 * x_BH + 5 * x_Combo <= 10  
2. Bananas stock: 0 * x_BH + 6 * x_Combo <= 20  
3. Grapes stock: 30 * x_BH + 20 * x_Combo <= 80

--------------------------------------------------
Below is the expected output in the requested JSON schema format:

{
  "variables": {
    "PackageCount": {
      "0": "x_BH (number of banana-haters packages, nonnegative integer)",
      "1": "x_Combo (number of combo packages, nonnegative integer)"
    }
  },
  "objective": "Maximize 6 * x_BH + 7 * x_Combo (euros)"
}

--------------------------------------------------

Model Comments:
- All parameter units are expressed in “units of fruit” for resources and “euros” for profit.
- The constraints ensure that the available stock for apples, bananas, and grapes is not exceeded by the packages produced.
- This model assumes that the entire fruit stock is available at the beginning of the period and that any produced package immediately consumes the corresponding resources.
- If a continuous (noninteger) decision is acceptable, the integer restriction can be relaxed.
- This formulation keeps the model simple so it can be easily mapped into code using Python or optimization tools like OR-Tools.
