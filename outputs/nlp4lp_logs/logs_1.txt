........................................................................................................................
--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Sets:
- CookieTypes: {Strawberry, Sugar}

Parameters:
- profit: dictionary with profit per cookie [USD per cookie]
  • profit[Strawberry] = 5.5
  • profit[Sugar] = 12.0
- maxDemand: dictionary with maximum daily demand [cookies]
  • maxDemand[Strawberry] = 100
  • maxDemand[Sugar] = 80
- maxDailyProduction: maximum total cookies that can be produced per day due to staffing (cookies per day)
  • maxDailyProduction = 100

Variables:
- x[c]: number of cookies of type c to produce [integer ≥ 0 or float ≥ 0, representing cookies]
  • For c in CookieTypes

Objective:
- Maximize total profit = profit[Strawberry] * x[Strawberry] + profit[Sugar] * x[Sugar]

Constraints:
1. Demand constraints:
   • x[Strawberry] ≤ maxDemand[Strawberry]
   • x[Sugar] ≤ maxDemand[Sugar]
2. Production capacity constraint due to staffing:
   • x[Strawberry] + x[Sugar] ≤ maxDailyProduction

Model Comments:
- All parameters are expressed in consistent units: profits in USD per cookie, production and demand in cookies.
- Although cookies are naturally integer units, the formulation allows for continuous variables; if integer solutions are required, x[c] can be specified as integer.
- The overall production constraint reflects the limited staffing capacity rather than a machine or ingredient limit.
- This structured model is directly translatable to Python or OR-Tools code.

They can also deliver more food by hand, due to the increased mobility, and have 85 customer interactions while refilling food twenty times an hour. However, the customers get more options when delivering by cart, therefore at least 70% of delivery shifts must be by cart.

........................................................................................................................
--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Sets:
- D: set of delivery modes = {Cart, Hand}

Parameters:
- interactions_Cart: number of customer interactions per hour for a cart server = 70 [interactions/server·hour]
- interactions_Hand: number of customer interactions per hour for a hand server = 85 [interactions/server·hour]
- refills_Cart: number of refills per hour for a cart server = 5 [refills/server·hour]
- refills_Hand: number of refills per hour for a hand server = 20 [refills/server·hour]
- required_interactions: required total customer interactions per hour = 4000 [interactions/hour]
- cart_shift_percentage: minimum percentage of shifts to be delivered by cart = 0.70 [unitless]
- min_hand_servers: minimum number of servers delivering by hand = 3 [servers]

Variables:
- x_Cart: number of cart delivery servers scheduled (continuous, nonnegative) [servers]
- x_Hand: number of hand delivery servers scheduled (continuous, nonnegative) [servers]

Objective:
- Minimize total refills per hour = (refills_Cart * x_Cart) + (refills_Hand * x_Hand)

Constraints:
1. Customer interaction constraint:
   interactions_Cart * x_Cart + interactions_Hand * x_Hand = required_interactions
   (i.e., 70 * x_Cart + 85 * x_Hand = 4000)

2. Delivery mode ratio (at least 70% by cart):
   x_Cart >= cart_shift_percentage * (x_Cart + x_Hand)
   (This is equivalent to x_Cart >= 0.7*(x_Cart + x_Hand))

3. Minimum hand delivery servers:
   x_Hand >= min_hand_servers

Comments:
- All parameters are expressed per hour.
- The decision variables x_Cart and x_Hand are modeled as continuous for scheduling purposes. If only integer numbers of servers can be scheduled, these should be declared as integers.
- The customer interaction constraint is set to equality to exactly meet the desired 4000 interactions per hour.
- The delivery mode ratio constraint can be algebraically rearranged (x_Cart >= (7/3)*x_Hand) if needed for simplification.

- imported_B: imported material required per dose of medicine B = 40 [units per dose]
- mRNA_A: mRNA required per dose of medicine A = 50 [units per dose]

- treat_B: number of people treated per dose of medicine B = 8 [people per dose]
- max_imported: available imported material = 300 [units]
- max_mRNA: available mRNA = 400 [units]
- max_doses_A: maximum doses of medicine A that can be produced = 5 [doses]
- epsilon: a small positive number to enforce that doses of medicine B are strictly greater than doses of medicine A (e.g., 0.001)

Variables:
- DosesA: number of doses of medicine A produced [continuous; expected to be integer in practice; units: doses]
- DosesB: number of doses of medicine B produced [continuous; expected to be integer in practice; units: doses]

Objective:
- Maximize total number of people treated = (treat_A * DosesA) + (treat_B * DosesB)

Constraints:
1. Imported material constraint:
   (imported_A * DosesA) + (imported_B * DosesB) <= max_imported
2. mRNA constraint:
   (mRNA_A * DosesA) + (mRNA_B * DosesB) <= max_mRNA
3. Production limit for medicine A:
   DosesA <= max_doses_A
4. Relative production constraint:
   DosesB >= DosesA + epsilon
   (Note: The epsilon parameter ensures that the number of doses of medicine B is strictly larger than the number of doses of medicine A. If a nonstrict inequality (i.e., DosesB >= DosesA) is acceptable, then epsilon may be set to 0.)

--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Sets:
- P: set of product types = {MedicationPatch, AntiBioticCream}

Parameters:
- prepTimePatch: preparation time per batch of medication patches [minutes] = 3
- materialPatch: material required per batch of medication patches [material units] = 5
- treatPatch: number of people treated per batch of medication patches [people per batch] = 3
- prepTimeCream: preparation time per batch of anti-biotic creams [minutes] = 5
- materialCream: material required per batch of anti-biotic creams [material units] = 6
- treatCream: number of people treated per batch of anti-biotic creams [people per batch] = 2
- totalStaffTime: total staff time available [minutes] = 400
- totalMaterial: total material available [material units] = 530
- totalBatchesLimit: maximum total batches that can be stored [batches] = 100

Variables:
- NumBatchesMedicationPatch: number of batches of medication patches produced [non-negative real number]
- NumBatchesAntiBioticCream: number of batches of anti-biotic creams produced [non-negative real number]

Objective:
- Maximize the total number of people treated:
  Maximize (treatPatch * NumBatchesMedicationPatch + treatCream * NumBatchesAntiBioticCream)
  which translates to: Maximize (3 * NumBatchesMedicationPatch + 2 * NumBatchesAntiBioticCream)

Constraints:
1. Staff time constraint:
   (prepTimePatch * NumBatchesMedicationPatch + prepTimeCream * NumBatchesAntiBioticCream) ≤ totalStaffTime
   → 3 * NumBatchesMedicationPatch + 5 * NumBatchesAntiBioticCream ≤ 400
2. Material constraint:
   (materialPatch * NumBatchesMedicationPatch + materialCream * NumBatchesAntiBioticCream) ≤ totalMaterial
   → 5 * NumBatchesMedicationPatch + 6 * NumBatchesAntiBioticCream ≤ 530
3. Storage (batch) constraint:
   NumBatchesMedicationPatch + NumBatchesAntiBioticCream ≤ totalBatchesLimit
   → NumBatchesMedicationPatch + NumBatchesAntiBioticCream ≤ 100
4. Demand ratio constraint:
   The number of anti-biotic cream batches must be at least twice the number of medication patch batches:
   → NumBatchesAntiBioticCream ≥ 2 * NumBatchesMedicationPatch
5. Non-negativity:
   NumBatchesMedicationPatch ≥ 0, NumBatchesAntiBioticCream ≥ 0

Model Comments:
- Units are consistent: time in minutes and materials in material units.
- While batches are typically integers, the model variables are defined as non-negative real numbers (floats) to match the expected output schema. Adjust to integer requirements if necessary.

--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Sets:
- BINS: {Small, Large}

Parameters:
- workers_per_small: 2 (workers required per small bin)
- workers_per_large: 5 (workers required per large bin)
- capacity_small: 25 (units of recycling material held per small bin)
- capacity_large: 60 (units of recycling material held per large bin)
- total_workers: 100 (available workers)
- ratio_small_to_large: 3 (the number of small bins must equal 3 times the number of large bins)
- min_small: 10 (minimum number of small bins required)
- min_large: 4 (minimum number of large bins required)

Variables:
- NumberSmallBins: integer variable ≥ 0 (number of small bins to deploy)
- NumberLargeBins: integer variable ≥ 0 (number of large bins to deploy)

Objective:
- Maximize total capacity collected = (capacity_small * NumberSmallBins) + (capacity_large * NumberLargeBins)

Constraints:
1. Worker Constraint:
   - workers_per_small * NumberSmallBins + workers_per_large * NumberLargeBins ≤ total_workers
   - In other words: 2 * NumberSmallBins + 5 * NumberLargeBins ≤ 100

2. Ratio Constraint:
   - NumberSmallBins = ratio_small_to_large * NumberLargeBins
   - That is: NumberSmallBins = 3 * NumberLargeBins

3. Minimum Bin Constraints:
   - NumberSmallBins ≥ min_small  →  NumberSmallBins ≥ 10
   - NumberLargeBins ≥ min_large  →  NumberLargeBins ≥ 4

Additional Comments:
- All units are consistent: worker counts (workers/bin) and recycling capacity (units/bin).
- Although the ratio constraint determines NumberSmallBins exactly as three times NumberLargeBins, the lower bounds (10 for small and 4 for large) must be explicitly enforced to ensure feasibility.
- Decision variables are defined as integers since you cannot deploy a fractional bin.

This completes the mathematical model using the five-element framework.

........................................................................................................................
--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Below is a complete translation of the problem using the five-element framework.

------------------------------------------------------------
Sets:
- TripModes: the set of transportation methods used = {Boat, Canoe}

------------------------------------------------------------
Parameters:
- boat_capacity = 10 ducks per boat trip
- canoe_capacity = 8 ducks per canoe trip
- boat_time = 20 minutes per boat trip
- canoe_time = 40 minutes per canoe trip
- max_boat_trips = 12 trips (boats cannot be used more than 12 times)
- ducks_required = 300 ducks (at least 300 ducks must be transported)
- min_canoe_proportion = 0.6 (at least 60% of all trips must be by canoe)

------------------------------------------------------------
Variables:
- BoatTrips: number of trips made by boat; nonnegative integer (or float if integrality is relaxed) [units: trips]
- CanoeTrips: number of trips made by canoe; nonnegative integer (or float if integrality is relaxed) [units: trips]

------------------------------------------------------------
Objective:
Minimize TotalTime where
  TotalTime = (boat_time * BoatTrips) + (canoe_time * CanoeTrips)
In other words, minimize 20 * BoatTrips + 40 * CanoeTrips [units: minutes]

------------------------------------------------------------
Constraints:
1. Boat trips limit:
   BoatTrips <= max_boat_trips 
   (i.e., BoatTrips <= 12)

2. Duck transport capacity requirement:
   (boat_capacity * BoatTrips) + (canoe_capacity * CanoeTrips) >= ducks_required 
   (i.e., 10*BoatTrips + 8*CanoeTrips >= 300)

3. Minimum canoe trips proportion:
   CanoeTrips >= min_canoe_proportion * (BoatTrips + CanoeTrips)
   This can be rearranged for clarity:
     CanoeTrips >= 0.6 * (BoatTrips + CanoeTrips)
   Equivalently, subtracting 0.6 * CanoeTrips from both sides:
     0.4 * CanoeTrips >= 0.6 * BoatTrips 
   Which can be simplified to:
     CanoeTrips >= 1.5 * BoatTrips

------------------------------------------------------------
Model Comments:
- All time parameters are in minutes, capacities are in ducks per trip, and trips are counts.
- The decision variables may be modelled as integers if an exactly countable number of trips is required.
- The minimum canoe trips constraint ensures that at least 60% of the total trips are by canoe.
- This formulation minimizes the total time required to transport a minimum of 300 ducks under the given operational limits.

........................................................................................................................
--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Sets:
- BIRDS: set of bird types = {CarrierPigeon, Owl}

Parameters:
- LettersPerPigeon: number of letters carried per carrier pigeon = 2 [letters/bird]
- LettersPerOwl: number of letters carried per owl = 5 [letters/bird]
- TreatsPerPigeon: treats required for one carrier pigeon service = 3 [treats/bird]
- TreatsPerOwl: treats required for one owl service = 5 [treats/bird]
- MaxTreats: total treats available = 1000 [treats]
- MaxOwlRatio: maximum fraction of birds that can be owls = 0.40 [fraction]
- MinPigeons: minimum number of carrier pigeons required = 20 [birds]

Variables:
- NumPigeons: number of carrier pigeons to use; integer variable, NumPigeons ≥ 0
- NumOwls: number of owls to use; integer variable, NumOwls ≥ 0

Objective:
- Maximize TotalLettersSent = LettersPerPigeon * NumPigeons + LettersPerOwl * NumOwls
  (This represents the total number of letters that can be sent.)

Constraints:
1. Treats constraint: TreatsPerPigeon * NumPigeons + TreatsPerOwl * NumOwls ≤ MaxTreats  
   (Ensures total treats consumed by both types of birds do not exceed available treats.)
2. Owl ratio constraint: NumOwls ≤ MaxOwlRatio * (NumPigeons + NumOwls)  
   (Ensures that at most 40% of the birds are owls.)
   - This constraint can be algebraically rearranged if needed as: NumOwls ≤ (MaxOwlRatio / (1 - MaxOwlRatio)) * NumPigeons.
   - With MaxOwlRatio = 0.40, it becomes: NumOwls ≤ (0.40/0.60)*NumPigeons = (2/3)*NumPigeons.
3. Minimum carrier pigeons constraint: NumPigeons ≥ MinPigeons  
   (Guarantees that at least 20 carrier pigeons are used.)

- pollution[Sedan] = 10   (pollution units generated by a sedan per day)
- pollution[Bus] = 40     (pollution units generated by a bus per day)
- maxPollution = 800      (maximum allowable pollution units per day)
- minTourists = 4600      (minimum number of tourists that must be served per day)
  (Assumption: All values are per day and consistent in units)

Variables:
- NumberOfSedans: number of sedans to purchase (integer, ≥ 0)
- NumberOfBuses: number of buses to purchase (integer, ≥ 0)

Objective:
- Minimize the total number of vehicles purchased, expressed as:
  TotalVehicles = NumberOfSedans + NumberOfBuses

Constraints:
1. Pollution Constraint:
   pollution[Sedan] * NumberOfSedans + pollution[Bus] * NumberOfBuses ≤ maxPollution
   i.e., 10 * NumberOfSedans + 40 * NumberOfBuses ≤ 800

2. Capacity Constraint (to serve at least the minimum number of tourists):
   seats[Sedan] * NumberOfSedans + seats[Bus] * NumberOfBuses ≥ minTourists

--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Below is one precise formulation of the problem using the five-element structure.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Sets:
- Vehicles = {tractor, car}  
  (Although the vehicles are described individually, the set is provided for clarity. Each vehicle type has a fixed capacity.)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Parameters:
- capacity_tractor = 40 (kg per tractor)  
- capacity_car = 20 (kg per car)  
- minimum_corn = 500 (kg required to be transported)  
- car_to_tractor_ratio = 2  
  (This means the number of cars must be at least twice the number of tractors.)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Variables:
- NumberOfTractorsUsed, an integer ≥ 0  
  (Represents the number of tractors used for transporting corn.)
- NumberOfCarsUsed, an integer ≥ 0  
  (Represents the number of cars used for transporting corn.)
- CornTractor, a float ≥ 0  
  (Amount of corn transported by tractors in kg; defined as CornTractor = capacity_tractor * NumberOfTractorsUsed.)
- CornCar, a float ≥ 0  
  (Amount of corn transported by cars in kg; defined as CornCar = capacity_car * NumberOfCarsUsed.)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Objective:
- Minimize total vehicles = NumberOfTractorsUsed + NumberOfCarsUsed  
  (The goal is to minimize the total count of vehicles used.)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Constraints:
1. Total corn transported meets the minimum requirement:  
   CornTractor + CornCar ≥ minimum_corn  
   (In expanded form: 40 * NumberOfTractorsUsed + 20 * NumberOfCarsUsed ≥ 500)

2. Vehicle mix constraint (cars are used at least twice as much as tractors):  
   NumberOfCarsUsed ≥ car_to_tractor_ratio * NumberOfTractorsUsed  
   (In expanded form: NumberOfCarsUsed ≥ 2 * NumberOfTractorsUsed)

3. Definitions of corn transported by each vehicle type:  
   CornTractor = capacity_tractor * NumberOfTractorsUsed  
   CornCar = capacity_car * NumberOfCarsUsed

--------------------------------------------------------------------
The final JSON output following the Expected Output Schema is:

{
  "variables": {
    "NumberOfCarsUsed": "integer >= 0 (number of cars used)",
    "NumberOfTractorsUsed": "integer >= 0 (number of tractors used)",
    "CornTractor": "float >= 0 (corn transported by tractors in kg = 40 * NumberOfTractorsUsed)",
    "CornCar": "float >= 0 (corn transported by cars in kg = 20 * NumberOfCarsUsed)"
  },
  "objective": "Minimize total vehicles = NumberOfTractorsUsed + NumberOfCarsUsed"
}

This complete model is now ready for implementation in a coding environment.

........................................................................................................................
--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Sets:
- T: set of tables = {1, 2}

Parameters:
- powder_usage[t]: units of powder used at table t. Values: powder_usage[1] = 3 (units per setup), powder_usage[2] = 8 (units per setup)
- glue_usage[t]: units of glue used at table t. Values: glue_usage[1] = 5 (units per setup), glue_usage[2] = 6 (units per setup)
- slime_production[t]: units of slime produced at table t. Values: slime_production[1] = 4 (units per setup), slime_production[2] = 5 (units per setup)
- mess_production[t]: units of mess produced at table t. Values: mess_production[1] = 2 (units per setup), mess_production[2] = 4 (units per setup)
- available_powder: total available powder = 100 (units)
- available_glue: total available glue = 90 (units)
- max_mess: maximum allowable mess = 30 (units)

Variables:
- x[t]: number of setups at table t, where t ∈ T. 
  -- Decision variables are nonnegative integers (or continuous if fractional setups are allowed, but usually setups are integer). Assume integer ≥ 0.

Objective:
- Maximize total slime produced = sum over t in T of (slime_production[t] * x[t])
  (Units: units of slime)

Constraints:
1. Powder constraint: sum over t in T of (powder_usage[t] * x[t]) ≤ available_powder  
   (Interpretation: total powder used should not exceed 100 units)
2. Glue constraint: sum over t in T of (glue_usage[t] * x[t]) ≤ available_glue  
   (Interpretation: total glue used should not exceed 90 units)
3. Mess constraint: sum over t in T of (mess_production[t] * x[t]) ≤ max_mess  
   (Interpretation: total mess produced should not exceed 30 units)

Notes:
- All units are assumed to be consistent: "units" represents the same measurement across powder, glue, slime, and mess.
- Decision variables (x[1], x[2]) represent how many setups (or batches) of slime production to run at each corresponding table.
- This formulation is self-contained and directly translatable into Python or OR-Tools code.

........................................................................................................................
--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Sets:
- M: set of washing machine types = {TopLoading, FrontLoading}

Parameters:
- WashItems_T: number of items washed per day by a top-loading machine = 50 [items/day]
- WashItems_F: number of items washed per day by a front-loading machine = 75 [items/day]
- Power_T: power consumption per day of a top-loading machine = 85 [kWh/day]
- Power_F: power consumption per day of a front-loading machine = 100 [kWh/day]
- MinItems: minimum items to wash per day = 5000 [items]
- AvailablePower: available power per day = 7000 [kWh]
- MaxTopFraction: maximum fraction of machines that may be top-loading = 0.40 [fraction]
- MinFront: minimum number of front-loading machines required = 10 [machines]

Variables:
- NumTopLoading: number of top-loading machines to buy [integer ≥ 0]
- NumFrontLoading: number of front-loading machines to buy [integer ≥ 0]

Objective:
- Minimize TotalMachines = NumTopLoading + NumFrontLoading

Constraints:
1. Washing capacity constraint:
   (WashItems_T * NumTopLoading) + (WashItems_F * NumFrontLoading) ≥ MinItems

2. Power consumption constraint:
   (Power_T * NumTopLoading) + (Power_F * NumFrontLoading) ≤ AvailablePower

3. Top-loading machine fraction constraint:
   NumTopLoading ≤ MaxTopFraction * (NumTopLoading + NumFrontLoading)

4. Minimum front-loading machines constraint:
   NumFrontLoading ≥ MinFront

Comments:
- All machines are counted as whole units.
- The model assumes that daily performance attributes (items washed, kWh used per day) are additive across machines.
- The top-loading fraction constraint ensures that no more than 40% of the total machines are top-loading, which addresses usability concerns.
- The objective is to minimize the total number of machines purchased while satisfying operational constraints.

This structured model provides a clear formulation that can be directly translated into Python or an optimization solver using OR-Tools.

Parameters:
- luggage_capacity[4-wheel] = 60 (luggage moved per day per 4-wheeler)
- luggage_capacity[3-wheel] = 40 (luggage moved per day per 3-wheeler)
- pollutant[4-wheel] = 30 (pollutant units produced per day per 4-wheeler)

- required_luggage = 1000 (minimum luggage to be moved per day)
- max_pollutant = 430 (maximum pollutant allowed per day)

Variables:
- x[v] for each v in V: number of vehicles of type v to buy [integer, nonnegative]
  (Interpretation: x["4-wheel"] is the number of 4-wheeler vehicles; x["3-wheel"] is the number of 3-wheeler vehicles.)

Objective:
- Minimize the total number of vehicles, expressed as: 
  TotalVehicles = x["4-wheel"] + x["3-wheel"]

Constraints:
1. Luggage movement requirement:
  (luggage_capacity[4-wheel] * x["4-wheel"]) + (luggage_capacity[3-wheel] * x["3-wheel"]) ≥ required_luggage
  (This ensures that at least 1000 luggage items are moved per day.)

2. Pollutant limit requirement:
  (pollutant[4-wheel] * x["4-wheel"]) + (pollutant[3-wheel] * x["3-wheel"]) ≤ max_pollutant

- Minimize total fat intake per week = (15 * x_almonds) + (12 * x_cashews)
  (Units: total grams of fat per week)

Constraints:
1. Calorie constraint: (200 * x_almonds) + (300 * x_cashews) ≥ 10000
2. Protein constraint: (20 * x_almonds) + (25 * x_cashews) ≥ 800
3. Almond-to-Cashew ratio constraint: x_almonds ≥ 2 * x_cashews

Sets:
- B: set of beams = {Beam1, Beam2}

Parameters:
- pancreas_rate: dose delivered to the pancreas per minute
  - For Beam1: 0.3 [units/minute]
  - For Beam2: 0.2 [units/minute]
- skin_rate: dose delivered to the skin per minute
  - For Beam1: 0.2 [units/minute]

Variables:
- MinutesBeam1: continuous variable representing the number of minutes to use Beam1 [minutes, ≥ 0]
- MinutesBeam2: continuous variable representing the number of minutes to use Beam2 [minutes, ≥ 0]

Objective:
- Minimize total dose to the pancreas = 0.3 * MinutesBeam1 + 0.2 * MinutesBeam2

Constraints:
1. Skin dose constraint:
   - 0.2 * MinutesBeam1 + 0.1 * MinutesBeam2 ≤ max_skin_dose
2. Tumor dose constraint:
   - 0.6 * MinutesBeam1 + 0.4 * MinutesBeam2 ≥ min_tumor_dose

Notes:
- All units are assumed to be consistent (dose units per minute and minutes for time).
- The decision variables (MinutesBeam1 and MinutesBeam2) are continuous, non-negative values.
- The model aims to minimize the harm to the pancreas by reducing its radiation exposure while satisfying the treatment requirements for the skin and tumor.

--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Below is a complete five-element model formulation for the oil well acreage allocation problem.

-----------------------------
Sets:
- W: set of oil well types = {small, large}

-----------------------------
Parameters:
- TotalAcres: total acres available for allocation (acres) = 300
- Production[w]: oil produced per acre when using well type w (barrels per acre)
  • Production[small] = 2
  • Production[large] = 5
- DrillBitUsage[w]: number of drill bits required per acre for well type w (bits per acre)
  • DrillBitUsage[small] = 5
  • DrillBitUsage[large] = 10
- Pollution[w]: pollution generated per acre for well type w (pollution units per acre)
  • Pollution[small] = 10
  • Pollution[large] = 20
- TotalDrillBits: total available drill bits (bits) = 2500
- MaxPollution: maximum allowable pollution (pollution units) = 4500

-----------------------------
Variables:
- AcreAllocation[w]: acres allocated to well type w
  • AcreAllocation[w] is continuous and ≥ 0  (for w in W)
  [Interpretation: Decision variable for how many acres to use for each oil well type.]

-----------------------------
Objective:
- Maximize TotalOilProduction, where
  TotalOilProduction = sum over w in W of (Production[w] * AcreAllocation[w])
  [Units: barrels]

-----------------------------
Constraints:
1. Land Availability Constraint:
  sum over w in W of AcreAllocation[w] ≤ TotalAcres
    [Total acres allocated must not exceed 300 acres.]

2. Drill Bit Availability Constraint:
  sum over w in W of (DrillBitUsage[w] * AcreAllocation[w]) ≤ TotalDrillBits
    [Total drill bits used cannot exceed 2500 bits.]

3. Pollution Constraint:
  sum over w in W of (Pollution[w] * AcreAllocation[w]) ≤ MaxPollution
    [Total pollution generated must not exceed 4500 pollution units.]

-----------------------------

This model is self-contained and uses clear, consistent units (acres, barrels, bits, pollution units) as given in the problem description. The decision variables (AcreAllocation[small] and AcreAllocation[large]) represent the acreage on which each type of oil well is used, and the objective is to maximize total oil production while satisfying land, resource, and environmental constraints.

  days_Old >= 0, days_New >= 0

Notes:
• All units are in dollars for costs and kilograms for production and requirements.
• It is assumed that operating a farm for a fractional number of days is acceptable. If days must be integer, then the variable type should be changed accordingly.

This structured model is complete and ready to be translated into a working LP implementation.

........................................................................................................................
--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Sets:
- P: set of processes = {ProcessA, ProcessB}

Parameters:
- goldRequired[ProcessA] = 3 (units of gold per execution of ProcessA)
- wireRequired[ProcessA] = 2 (units of wires per execution of ProcessA)
- coinsProduced[ProcessA] = 5 (coins plated per execution of ProcessA)
- goldRequired[ProcessB] = 5 (units of gold per execution of ProcessB)
- wireRequired[ProcessB] = 3 (units of wires per execution of ProcessB)
- coinsProduced[ProcessB] = 7 (coins plated per execution of ProcessB)
- totalGoldAvailable = 500 (total units of gold available)
- totalWiresAvailable = 300 (total units of wires available)
  
Variables:
- ExecuteProcessA: number of times ProcessA is executed (nonnegative, float; can be later restricted to integer if required)
- ExecuteProcessB: number of times ProcessB is executed (nonnegative, float; can be later restricted to integer if required)

Objective:
- Maximize total number of coins plated, defined as:
  TotalCoins = (coinsProduced[ProcessA] * ExecuteProcessA) + (coinsProduced[ProcessB] * ExecuteProcessB)

Constraints:
1. Gold constraint:
   (goldRequired[ProcessA] * ExecuteProcessA) + (goldRequired[ProcessB] * ExecuteProcessB) <= totalGoldAvailable

2. Wire constraint:
   (wireRequired[ProcessA] * ExecuteProcessA) + (wireRequired[ProcessB] * ExecuteProcessB) <= totalWiresAvailable

Model Comments:
- All units are assumed consistent: gold in units, wires in units, coins as output quantity.
- The decision variables represent the number of times each process is executed. Although defined as float here, if the process executions must be whole numbers, they can be required to be integers.
- The objective function focuses solely on maximizing the total coins plated and does not consider any cost since none were provided.

........................................................................................................................
--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Sets:
- Kegs: {Small, Large}

Parameters:
- CapacitySmall: capacity of a small keg in liters = 40 liters
- CapacityLarge: capacity of a large keg in liters = 100 liters
- MaxSmallKegsAvailable: maximum number of small kegs available = 30
- MaxLargeKegsAvailable: maximum number of large kegs available = 10
- MaxTotalKegsTransport: maximum number of kegs that can be transported = 25
- MinLargeKegsRequired: minimum number of large kegs to be used = 5
- MinSmallToLargeRatio: required ratio such that the number of small kegs used is at least twice that of large kegs (i.e., SmallKegsUsed >= 2 * LargeKegsUsed)

Variables:
- NumSmallKegsUsed: number of small kegs to use [integer, 0 <= NumSmallKegsUsed <= MaxSmallKegsAvailable]
- NumLargeKegsUsed: number of large kegs to use [integer, 0 <= NumLargeKegsUsed <= MaxLargeKegsAvailable]

Objective:
- Maximize TotalWaterTransported, where TotalWaterTransported = (CapacitySmall * NumSmallKegsUsed) + (CapacityLarge * NumLargeKegsUsed)
  (The unit is liters)

Constraints:
1. Keg Availability Constraints:
   - NumSmallKegsUsed <= MaxSmallKegsAvailable
   - NumLargeKegsUsed <= MaxLargeKegsAvailable
2. Total Kegs Constraint:
   - NumSmallKegsUsed + NumLargeKegsUsed <= MaxTotalKegsTransport
3. Minimum Large Kegs Constraint:
   - NumLargeKegsUsed >= MinLargeKegsRequired
4. Small-to-Large Ratio Constraint:
   - NumSmallKegsUsed >= MinSmallToLargeRatio * NumLargeKegsUsed

Comments:
- All parameters are in consistent units (kegs for counts and liters for volume).
- The decision variables are modeled as integers although the expected output schema mentions floats; in practice, kegs must be whole numbers.
- The model maximizes the total liters of glacial water that can be transported.

This structured model is self-contained and ready to be implemented in Python or OR-Tools code.

Variables:
- DualStampMachines: integer, number of Dual stamping machines purchased (>= 0)
- SingleStampMachines: integer, number of Single stamping machines purchased (>= 0)

Objective:
- Minimize TotalMachines = SingleStampMachines + DualStampMachines

Constraints:
1. Letters production constraint:

   i.e., 20 * DualStampMachines + 15 * SingleStampMachines <= 135

3. Quiet operation constraint (Single machines must outnumber Dual machines):
   SingleStampMachines - DualStampMachines >= quiet_gap
   i.e., SingleStampMachines - DualStampMachines >= 1

4. Non-negativity and integrality constraints:
   DualStampMachines ∈ {0, 1, 2, ...}
   SingleStampMachines ∈ {0, 1, 2, ...}

Objective:
- Minimize total production time in minutes = productionTimeMocha * NumMocha + productionTimeRegular * NumRegularCoffee
  That is, minimize (5 * NumMocha + 3 * NumRegularCoffee)

Constraints:
1. Coffee powder constraint:

Comments:
- All unit quantities are assumed to be consistent (e.g., production time in minutes, material usage in units).
- Although production quantities are typically integers, the expected output schema specifies float variables for NumMocha and NumRegularCoffee.
- This model minimizes the total production time subject to resource and ratio constraints, and is ready to be implemented using Python or OR-Tools code.

Problem description: An amusement park is installing ticket machines, both cash-based and card-only machines. A cash-based machine can process 20 people per hour while a card-only machine can process 30 people per hour. The cash-based machine needs 4 rolls of paper per hour while the card-only machine requires 5 rolls of paper per hour. The amusement park needs to be able to process at least 500 people per hour but can use at most 90 rolls of paper per hour. Since most people prefer to pay by cash, the number of card-only machines must not exceed the number of cash-based machines. How many of each machine should be bought to minimize the total number of machines in the park?

--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Sets:
- M: set of machine types = {Cash, Card}

Parameters:
- capacity_Cash: processing capacity of one cash-based machine [persons per hour] = 20
- capacity_Card: processing capacity of one card-only machine [persons per hour] = 30
- paper_Cash: paper usage of one cash-based machine [rolls per hour] = 4
- paper_Card: paper usage of one card-only machine [rolls per hour] = 5
- min_persons: minimum processing requirement [persons per hour] = 500
- max_rolls: maximum available paper rolls per hour = 90

Variables:
- NumCashMachines: number of cash-based ticket machines, integer ≥ 0 [units]
- NumCardMachines: number of card-only ticket machines, integer ≥ 0 [units]

Objective:
- Minimize TotalMachines = NumCashMachines + NumCardMachines
  (This minimizes the total number of machines installed.)

Constraints:
1. Processing capacity constraint:
   20 * NumCashMachines + 30 * NumCardMachines ≥ 500
   (Ensures that at least 500 persons can be processed per hour.)
2. Paper usage constraint:
   4 * NumCashMachines + 5 * NumCardMachines ≤ 90
   (Ensures that the park does not use more than 90 rolls of paper per hour.)
3. Machine preference constraint:
   NumCardMachines ≤ NumCashMachines
   (Since most people prefer to pay by cash, there cannot be more card-only machines than cash-based ones.)

- available_mint: total available mint (units) = 120
- available_active: total available active ingredient (units) = 100
- max_tar: maximum allowable black tar produced (units) = 50

Variables:
- x_d: number of times demonstration d is performed, for all d in Demos (nonnegative float; note: while the decision logically pertains to countable demonstrations, the expected output schema permits float)

Objective:
- Maximize total minty foam produced = foam_produced_1 * x_1 + foam_produced_2 * x_2

Constraints:
1. Mint constraint: mint_required_1 * x_1 + mint_required_2 * x_2 ≤ available_mint
2. Active ingredient constraint: active_required_1 * x_1 + active_required_2 * x_2 ≤ available_active
3. Black tar constraint: tar_produced_1 * x_1 + tar_produced_2 * x_2 ≤ max_tar

Comments:
- All units are assumed to be consistent (units for mint, active ingredient, foam, and tar are all as stated in the problem description).
- Although demonstrations are inherently discrete events, the expected schema defines decision variables as float so x_d is modeled as continuous.
- This structured model precisely represents the original optimization problem.

--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Below is the five‐element structured model for the oil and gas container and truck transportation problem.

--------------------------------------------------
Sets:
- V = {Containers, Trucks}  
  (Note: Although there are only two decision types, we list them to show that our decisions pertain to the two vehicle types.)

--------------------------------------------------
Parameters:
- container_capacity = 30   (units of oil per container)
- truck_capacity = 40       (units of oil per truck)
- min_oil = 2000            (minimum total oil to be transported, in oil units)
- min_containers = 15       (minimum number of containers required)
- max_truck_ratio = 0.5     (government restriction: the number of trucks must be at most half the number of containers)

--------------------------------------------------
Variables:
- NumContainers: Number of containers used (integer, ≥ 0) [units: container count]
- NumTrucks: Number of trucks used (integer, ≥ 0) [units: truck count]

--------------------------------------------------
Objective:
- Minimize Total_Vehicles = NumContainers + NumTrucks  
  (This represents the minimization of the total number of containers and trucks used.)

--------------------------------------------------
Constraints:
1. Oil Capacity Requirement:
   container_capacity * NumContainers + truck_capacity * NumTrucks ≥ min_oil  
   [The combined capacity of the containers and trucks must be at least 2000 units.]

2. Minimum Container Requirement:
   NumContainers ≥ min_containers  
   [At least 15 containers must be used.]

3. Truck-to-Container Ratio (Government Restriction):
   NumTrucks ≤ max_truck_ratio * NumContainers  
   [The number of trucks used must be no more than half the number of containers.]

--------------------------------------------------
Additional Comments:
- All parameters are assumed to be in consistent units (oil in "units" and vehicles as counts). 
- Although the expected output schema lists decision variables as floats, here the variables are defined as integers to reflect that the number of containers and trucks must be whole numbers.
  
--------------------------------------------------
Expected Output Schema Example for Reference:
{
  "variables": {
    "NumContainers": "float",
    "NumTrucks": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}

This complete and self-contained model can directly guide a working implementation in Python or OR-Tools.

........................................................................................................................
--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Sets:
- Companies: {New, Old}

Parameters:
- new_trip_capacity: Number of gifts delivered by the new company per trip (50 gifts per trip)
- old_trip_capacity: Number of gifts delivered by the old company per trip (70 gifts per trip)
- new_trip_diesel: Diesel consumption per trip for the new company (30 liters per trip)
- old_trip_diesel: Diesel consumption per trip for the old company (40 liters per trip)
- min_gifts: Minimum total number of gifts to deliver (1000 gifts)
- max_new_trips: Maximum number of trips allowed by the new company (15 trips)
- min_old_trip_ratio: Minimum fraction of total trips that must be made by the old company (0.40)

Variables:
- TripsNewCompany: Number of trips by the new company (integer, ≥ 0)
- TripsOldCompany: Number of trips by the old company (integer, ≥ 0)

Objective:
- Minimize total diesel usage = new_trip_diesel * TripsNewCompany + old_trip_diesel * TripsOldCompany

Constraints:
1. Gift Delivery Constraint:
   new_trip_capacity * TripsNewCompany + old_trip_capacity * TripsOldCompany ≥ min_gifts

2. New Company Trip Limit:
   TripsNewCompany ≤ max_new_trips

3. Minimum Old Company Trip Proportion:
   To ensure at least 40% of all trips are by the old company, the following must hold:
   TripsOldCompany ≥ min_old_trip_ratio * (TripsNewCompany + TripsOldCompany)
   This can be reformulated as:  TripsOldCompany - min_old_trip_ratio * (TripsNewCompany + TripsOldCompany) ≥ 0
   or equivalently:  (1 - min_old_trip_ratio)*TripsOldCompany - min_old_trip_ratio*TripsNewCompany ≥ 0
   With min_old_trip_ratio = 0.40, this becomes:
   0.60 * TripsOldCompany - 0.40 * TripsNewCompany ≥ 0
   which can also be written as:
   3 * TripsOldCompany - 2 * TripsNewCompany ≥ 0

Comments:
- All parameter units are consistent: capacities in gifts per trip, diesel usage in liters per trip, and the gift requirement in gifts.
- The decision variables are modeled as integers since trips are discrete counts.
- The model minimizes the total diesel consumption while ensuring sufficient delivery of gifts and the required distribution of trips between the companies.

    "TripsNewCompany": "integer",
    "TripsOldCompany": "integer"
  },
  "objective": "Minimize total diesel usage = 30 * TripsNewCompany + 40 * TripsOldCompany"

--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Sets:
- Product: {Almond, Pistachio}

Parameters:
- butter_per_almond = 5 (butter units needed per almond croissant)
- butter_per_pistachio = 3 (butter units needed per pistachio croissant)
- flour_per_almond = 8 (flour units needed per almond croissant)
- flour_per_pistachio = 6 (flour units needed per pistachio croissant)
- total_butter = 600 (available butter units)
- total_flour = 800 (available flour units)
- time_almond = 12 (production time per almond croissant in minutes)
- time_pistachio = 10 (production time per pistachio croissant in minutes)
- popularity_ratio = 3 (almond croissants must be at least 3 times the pistachio croissants)

Variables:
- QuantityAlmondCroissant (x_almond): number of almond croissants to produce, assumed integer and nonnegative.
- QuantityPistachioCroissant (x_pistachio): number of pistachio croissants to produce, assumed integer and nonnegative.

Objective:
- Minimize total production time = time_almond * x_almond + time_pistachio * x_pistachio
  In other words, minimize (12 * QuantityAlmondCroissant + 10 * QuantityPistachioCroissant).

Constraints:
1. Butter constraint: butter_per_almond * x_almond + butter_per_pistachio * x_pistachio ≤ total_butter  
   That is, 5 * QuantityAlmondCroissant + 3 * QuantityPistachioCroissant ≤ 600.
2. Flour constraint: flour_per_almond * x_almond + flour_per_pistachio * x_pistachio ≤ total_flour  
   That is, 8 * QuantityAlmondCroissant + 6 * QuantityPistachioCroissant ≤ 800.
3. Popularity constraint: x_almond ≥ popularity_ratio * x_pistachio  
   That is, QuantityAlmondCroissant ≥ 3 * QuantityPistachioCroissant.
4. Nonnegativity: x_almond, x_pistachio ≥ 0 and integer.

--------------------------------------------------

For clarity (expected output schema for a coding agent):

{
  "variables": {
    "QuantityAlmondCroissant": "integer (>=0)",
    "QuantityPistachioCroissant": "integer (>=0)"
  },
  "objective": "Minimize 12 * QuantityAlmondCroissant + 10 * QuantityPistachioCroissant"
}

This completes the structured mathematical model using the five-element framework.

--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Sets:
- Fruit: {Blueberries, Strawberries}

Parameters:
- antioxidant_per_pack: 
  - Blueberries = 3 units per pack
  - Strawberries = 1 unit per pack
- mineral_per_pack:
  - Blueberries = 5 units per pack
  - Strawberries = 7 units per pack
- sugar_per_pack:
  - Blueberries = 5 grams per pack
  - Strawberries = 7 grams per pack
- min_antioxidants = 90 units (total required)
- min_minerals = 100 units (total required)
- min_strawberry_ratio = 3 
  (This means the number of Strawberry packs should be at least 3 times the number of Blueberry packs)

Variables:
- NumberOfBlueberryPacks: integer variable, number of packs of blueberries to consume, with lower bound 0
- NumberOfStrawberryPacks: integer variable, number of packs of strawberries to consume, with lower bound 0

Objective:
- Minimize total sugar intake = (5 * NumberOfBlueberryPacks) + (7 * NumberOfStrawberryPacks)
  [Sugar is measured in grams]

Constraints:
1. Antioxidant requirement: (3 * NumberOfBlueberryPacks) + (1 * NumberOfStrawberryPacks) >= 90
2. Mineral requirement: (5 * NumberOfBlueberryPacks) + (7 * NumberOfStrawberryPacks) >= 100
3. Seasonal fruit ratio: NumberOfStrawberryPacks >= 3 * NumberOfBlueberryPacks

In summary, the model directs the dietician to choose nonnegative integer numbers for packs of blueberries and strawberries to minimize sugar intake while ensuring the client’s antioxidant and mineral needs are met and maintaining at least three times as many strawberry packs as blueberry packs.

........................................................................................................................
--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Sets:
- Rides = {Taxi, CompanyCar}

Parameters:
- taxi_capacity: number of employees per taxi ride, equals 2 [employees/ride]
- company_capacity: number of employees per company car ride, equals 3 [employees/ride]
- min_employees: minimum number of employees to be transported, equals 500 [employees]
- min_company_rides: minimum required company car rides, equals 30 [rides]
- max_company_ratio: maximum allowed ratio of company car rides among all rides, equals 0.60 [dimensionless]

Variables:
- taxi_rides: number of taxi rides to be provided, an integer ≥ 0 [rides]
- company_car_rides: number of company car rides to be provided, an integer ≥ 0 [rides]

Objective:
- Minimize the number of taxi rides, i.e., minimize taxi_rides

Constraints:
1. Employee Transportation Constraint:
   taxi_capacity * taxi_rides + company_capacity * company_car_rides ≥ min_employees
   
2. Minimum Company Rides Constraint:
   company_car_rides ≥ min_company_rides

3. Company Car Ride Ratio Constraint:
   company_car_rides ≤ max_company_ratio * (taxi_rides + company_car_rides)

Comments:
- The units are consistent: capacities are given in number of employees per ride while the total is in employees.
- Both taxi_rides and company_car_rides are assumed to be integer values since partial rides are not practical.
- The ratio constraint ensures that no more than 60% of all rides are company car rides.
- The objective is to minimize taxi_rides, which may motivate using as many company_car_rides as possible while still satisfying the ratio limit and other constraints.

--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Sets:
- P: set of streaming platforms = {PiTV, BetaVideo, GammaLive}

Parameters:
- cost_PiTV = 1200 (USD per commercial on Pi TV)
- cost_BetaVideo = 2000 (USD per commercial on Beta Video)
- cost_GammaLive = 4000 (USD per commercial on Gamma Live)
- reach_PiTV = 2000 (viewers per commercial on Pi TV)
- reach_BetaVideo = 5000 (viewers per commercial on Beta Video)
- reach_GammaLive = 9000 (viewers per commercial on Gamma Live)
- budget = 20000 (USD available per week)
- max_BetaVideo = 8 (maximum commercials allowed on Beta Video)
- gammaMaxFraction = 1/3 (maximum fraction of total commercials that may be on Gamma Live)
- piMinFraction = 0.20 (minimum fraction of total commercials that must be on Pi TV)

Variables:
- NumberPiTV: number of commercials to run on Pi TV [integer ≥ 0, units: commercials]
- NumberBetaVideo: number of commercials to run on Beta Video [integer ≥ 0, units: commercials]
- NumberGammaLive: number of commercials to run on Gamma Live [integer ≥ 0, units: commercials]

Objective:
- Maximize total audience reach, defined as:
  TotalReach = reach_PiTV * NumberPiTV + reach_BetaVideo * NumberBetaVideo + reach_GammaLive * NumberGammaLive

Constraints:
1. Budget constraint:
   cost_PiTV * NumberPiTV + cost_BetaVideo * NumberBetaVideo + cost_GammaLive * NumberGammaLive ≤ budget

2. Beta Video commercial limit:
   NumberBetaVideo ≤ max_BetaVideo

3. Gamma Live proportion constraint:
   NumberGammaLive ≤ gammaMaxFraction * (NumberPiTV + NumberBetaVideo + NumberGammaLive)

4. Pi TV minimum proportion constraint:
   NumberPiTV ≥ piMinFraction * (NumberPiTV + NumberBetaVideo + NumberGammaLive)

Additional Notes:
- All parameters use consistent units. Costs are in USD per commercial, audience reach is in viewers per commercial, and the budget is in USD per week.
- Decision variables are assumed to be integers as partial commercials are not meaningful.
- It is assumed that the specified proportions (at most one third and at least 20%) are computed with respect to the total number of commercials run.
- This model is self-contained and can be directly implemented using optimization libraries such as OR-Tools.

Constraints:
1. Sales Constraint: NumberOfPersonalLicenses + NumberOfCommercialLicenses ≤ max_total_licenses
   (This limits the total number of licenses sold per month.)
2. Production Budget Constraint: (cost_Personal * NumberOfPersonalLicenses) + (cost_Commercial * NumberOfCommercialLicenses) ≤ max_production_budget

- All units are consistent: resource units for water and alcohol, count units for produced sanitizers, and number of hands cleaned.
- The production numbers are assumed to be integer values since you cannot produce a fraction of a sanitizer.
- The constraint x["Foam"] ≥ x["Liquid"] + 1 ensures that foam production strictly exceeds liquid production.

This structured model fully represents the real-world optimization problem.

........................................................................................................................
--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Sets:
- C: set of container types = {Small, Large}

Parameters:
- unload_req_Small: persons required to unload one small container = 1 (person/container)
- unload_req_Large: persons required to unload one large container = 3 (persons/container)
- capacity_Small: sand capacity of one small container = 20 (units/container)
- capacity_Large: sand capacity of one large container = 50 (units/container)
- available_persons: total number of available people = 100 (persons)
- min_Small: minimum number of small containers to use = 5 (containers)
- min_Large: minimum number of large containers to use = 3 (containers)
- ratio_Small_to_Large: required ratio of small to large containers = 3 (i.e., SmallContainers must equal 3 * LargeContainers)

Variables:
- SmallContainers: number of small containers used (continuous or integer; if containers must be whole, then integer) [units: containers]
- LargeContainers: number of large containers used (continuous or integer; if containers must be whole, then integer) [units: containers]

Objective:
- Maximize total sand delivered, defined as 
  TotalSand = capacity_Small * SmallContainers + capacity_Large * LargeContainers 
  (units: sand units)

Constraints:
1. Personnel constraint: 
   unload_req_Small * SmallContainers + unload_req_Large * LargeContainers <= available_persons
   (i.e., 1 * SmallContainers + 3 * LargeContainers <= 100)

2. Ratio constraint for container usage:
   SmallContainers = ratio_Small_to_Large * LargeContainers
   (i.e., SmallContainers = 3 * LargeContainers)

3. Minimum containers constraints:
   - SmallContainers >= min_Small 
   - LargeContainers >= min_Large

Comments:
- It is assumed that containers are indivisible; hence, the decision variables can be modeled as integers in an actual implementation.
- This formulation uses consistent units: persons for unloading constraints and container capacity in sand units.
- The objective is to maximize the total delivered sand given the available unloading capacity and container requirements.

........................................................................................................................
--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Below is a complete and self-contained mathematical model following the five-element structure.

─────────────────────────────  
Sets:
• P: set of processes = {0, 1}
  – 0 denotes the process with a catalyst.
  – 1 denotes the process without a catalyst.

─────────────────────────────  
Parameters:
• wood_required[p]:
  – For p = 0 (with catalyst): 10 units of wood per process run.
  – For p = 1 (without catalyst): 15 units of wood per process run.
• oxygen_required[p]:
  – For p = 0: 20 units of oxygen per process run.
  – For p = 1: 12 units of oxygen per process run.
• CO2_produced[p]:
  – For p = 0: 15 units of carbon dioxide produced per process run.
  – For p = 1: 18 units of carbon dioxide produced per process run.
• total_wood: total available wood = 300 units.
• total_oxygen: total available oxygen = 300 units.

─────────────────────────────  
Variables:
• Let x[p] represent the number of times process p is used.
  – x[p] must be a nonnegative number. (In many practical cases x[p] would be integer if processes cannot be fractional.)
  For clarity, we denote:
    – x[0] = number of runs using the catalyst.
    – x[1] = number of runs without the catalyst.

─────────────────────────────  
Objective:
• Maximize total carbon dioxide produced.
  This is given by:
    Total_CO2 = CO2_produced[0]*x[0] + CO2_produced[1]*x[1]
             = 15*x[0] + 18*x[1].

─────────────────────────────  
Constraints:
1. Wood Constraint:
   The wood used by both processes cannot exceed the available wood.
     => wood_required[0]*x[0] + wood_required[1]*x[1] ≤ total_wood
     => 10*x[0] + 15*x[1] ≤ 300.
2. Oxygen Constraint:
   The oxygen used by both processes cannot exceed the available oxygen.
     => oxygen_required[0]*x[0] + oxygen_required[1]*x[1] ≤ total_oxygen
     => 20*x[0] + 12*x[1] ≤ 300.

─────────────────────────────  
Below is the model expressed in a JSON format matching the expected output schema:

  "variables": {
    "ProcessUsage": {
      "0": "float",
      "1": "float"
    }
  },
  "objective": "float"
}

In an implementation, x[0] and x[1] (or ProcessUsage[0] and ProcessUsage[1]) would be the decision variables, and the objective would be defined as 15*x[0] + 18*x[1] while ensuring that 10*x[0] + 15*x[1] ≤ 300 and 20*x[0] + 12*x[1] ≤ 300.

- note: All units are per minute.

Variables:
- NumPrinters[Premium]: number of premium printers to purchase (integer, ≥ 0)
- NumPrinters[Regular]: number of regular printers to purchase (integer, ≥ 0)

Objective:
- Minimize total_printers = NumPrinters[Premium] + NumPrinters[Regular]

Constraints:
1. Printing capacity constraint:
   30 * NumPrinters[Premium] + 20 * NumPrinters[Regular] ≥ min_print_capacity
2. Ink usage constraint:
   4 * NumPrinters[Premium] + 3 * NumPrinters[Regular] ≤ max_ink_usage
3. User-friendliness constraint (premium preference):
   NumPrinters[Regular] < NumPrinters[Premium]

Comments:
- The decision variables are assumed to be integers since fractional printers are not realistic.
- All units in the parameters are per minute, ensuring consistency in the model.
- The objective minimizes the total number of printers purchased, aligning with the office’s goal to optimize equipment count.

--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Below is the structured model using the five-element framework.

------------------------------------------------------------
Sets:
- M: set of meal types = {TurkeyDinner, TunaSaladSandwich}

Parameters:
- protein[m]: grams of protein per meal m
  • protein[TurkeyDinner] = 20 (grams per meal)
  • protein[TunaSaladSandwich] = 18 (grams per meal)
- carbs[m]: grams of carbohydrates per meal m
  • carbs[TurkeyDinner] = 30 (grams per meal)
  • carbs[TunaSaladSandwich] = 25 (grams per meal)
- fat[m]: grams of fat per meal m
  • fat[TurkeyDinner] = 12 (grams per meal)
  • fat[TunaSaladSandwich] = 8 (grams per meal)
- min_protein: minimum total protein required = 150 (grams)
- min_carbs: minimum total carbohydrates required = 200 (grams)
- max_turkey_ratio: maximum fraction of turkey dinner = 0.4

Variables:
- QuantityTurkey: number of turkey dinners to buy [continuous, ≥ 0] [meals]
- QuantityTuna: number of tuna salad sandwiches to buy [continuous, ≥ 0] [meals]

Objective:
- Minimize total fat intake = (12 * QuantityTurkey) + (8 * QuantityTuna)
  (Units: grams of fat)

Constraints:
1. Protein requirement:
  20 * QuantityTurkey + 18 * QuantityTuna ≥ min_protein
2. Carbohydrate requirement:
  30 * QuantityTurkey + 25 * QuantityTuna ≥ min_carbs
3. Turkey meal limitation (ensuring turkey dinners are at most 40% of total meals):
  QuantityTurkey ≤ max_turkey_ratio * (QuantityTurkey + QuantityTuna)

  - allergy_rate[Factory1] = 20 pills/hour
  - allergy_rate[Factory2] = 10 pills/hour
- fever_rate[f]: number of fever reducing pills produced per hour at factory f, with
  - fever_rate[Factory1] = 15 pills/hour
  - fever_rate[Factory2] = 30 pills/hour
- compound_consumption[f]: units of the rare compound used per hour at factory f, with

  - compound_consumption[Factory2] = 30 units/hour
- min_allergy: minimum required allergy pills = 700 pills
- min_fever: minimum required fever reducing pills = 600 pills
- max_compound: available units of rare compound = 1000 units

Variables:
- x[f]: operating hours for factory f (continuous nonnegative variable), where f ∈ F
  (x[Factory1] and x[Factory2])
- total_time: total operating time = x[Factory1] + x[Factory2] (continuous variable)

Objective:
- Minimize total_time = x[Factory1] + x[Factory2]
  (This represents the total hours required to run the factories.)

Constraints:
1. Allergy pills production constraint:
   20 * x[Factory1] + 10 * x[Factory2] ≥ 700
2. Fever reducing pills production constraint:
   15 * x[Factory1] + 30 * x[Factory2] ≥ 600

   20 * x[Factory1] + 30 * x[Factory2] ≤ 1000
4. Non-negativity constraints:
   x[Factory1] ≥ 0, x[Factory2] ≥ 0

----------------------------------------------------------
Model Comments:
- All production rates are given in pills per hour.
- Compound consumption rates are in units of the rare compound per hour.
- The objective minimizes the total operating hours across both factories.
- It is assumed that running a factory for one hour produces the stated quantities independently of the other factory.
- All units have been consistently applied according to the problem description.

Sets:
- Mode: set of transportation modes = {Ferry, LightRail}

Parameters:
- ferry_capacity = 20 (boxes per ferry trip)
- lightrail_capacity = 15 (boxes per light rail trip)
- min_boxes = 500 (minimum number of corn boxes to be sent)
- ratio_multiplier = 4 (light rail trips must be at least 4 times ferry trips)

Variables:
- FerryTrips: number of ferry trips to use (integer, ≥ 0)
- LightRailTrips: number of light rail trips to use (integer, ≥ 0)

Objective:
- Minimize total trips = FerryTrips + LightRailTrips

Constraints:
1. Shipment capacity constraint:
   - (ferry_capacity * FerryTrips) + (lightrail_capacity * LightRailTrips) ≥ min_boxes
   - That is, 20 * FerryTrips + 15 * LightRailTrips ≥ 500

2. Mode ratio constraint:
   - LightRailTrips ≥ ratio_multiplier * FerryTrips
   - That is, LightRailTrips ≥ 4 * FerryTrips

Notes:
- All units are consistent: box counts for corn and trips.  
- It is assumed that the trips must be integer numbers since fractional trips are not meaningful in this context.

- lycheeJuicePerLychee: amount of lychee juice required per Lychee bubble tea [units] = 6
- teaPerLychee: amount of tea required per Lychee bubble tea [units] = 6
- totalMangoJuice: total available mango juice [units] = 2000
- totalLycheeJuice: total available lychee juice [units] = 3000
- minLycheeFraction: minimum fraction of total bubble teas that must be lychee [fraction] = 0.4
- minMangoExcess: minimum excess of Mango bubble teas over Lychee bubble teas (to enforce Mango > Lychee) [units] = 1  
  (Note: Since strict inequalities cannot be enforced in LPs, we assume Mango count must be at least 1 unit greater than Lychee count.)

Variables:
- NumberOfMangoBubbleTeas (continuous, ≥ 0): number of Mango bubble teas to produce [bubbles]
- NumberOfLycheeBubbleTeas (continuous, ≥ 0): number of Lychee bubble teas to produce [bubbles]

Objective:
- Minimize total tea usage = (teaPerMango * NumberOfMangoBubbleTeas) + (teaPerLychee * NumberOfLycheeBubbleTeas)
  which is: minimize (8 * NumberOfMangoBubbleTeas + 6 * NumberOfLycheeBubbleTeas)

Constraints:
1. Mango Juice Constraint:
   - mangoJuicePerMango * NumberOfMangoBubbleTeas ≤ totalMangoJuice  
   That is: 4 * NumberOfMangoBubbleTeas ≤ 2000

2. Lychee Juice Constraint:
   - lycheeJuicePerLychee * NumberOfLycheeBubbleTeas ≤ totalLycheeJuice  
   That is: 6 * NumberOfLycheeBubbleTeas ≤ 3000

3. Flavor Composition Constraint (at least 40% must be Lychee):
   - NumberOfLycheeBubbleTeas ≥ minLycheeFraction * (NumberOfMangoBubbleTeas + NumberOfLycheeBubbleTeas)
   Rearranging, this is equivalent to: NumberOfMangoBubbleTeas ≤ (1 - minLycheeFraction) / minLycheeFraction * NumberOfLycheeBubbleTeas  
   With minLycheeFraction = 0.4, we have: NumberOfMangoBubbleTeas ≤ (0.6/0.4) * NumberOfLycheeBubbleTeas = 1.5 * NumberOfLycheeBubbleTeas

4. Mango Preference Constraint (Mango bubble teas must be produced in a larger number than Lychee bubble teas):

   That is: NumberOfMangoBubbleTeas ≥ NumberOfLycheeBubbleTeas + 1

........................................................................................................................
--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Sets:
- VehicleTypes: the set of available vehicle types = {truck, van}

Parameters:
- cap_truck: capacity of a truck per trip = 1000 patties per trip
- cap_van: capacity of a van per trip = 500 patties per trip
- cost_truck: shipping cost per truck trip = 300 USD per trip
- cost_van: shipping cost per van trip = 100 USD per trip
- demand: the minimum number of patties to ship = 50000 patties
- budget: the maximum allowed shipping cost = 12500 USD

Variables:
- Let NumTrips["0"] be the number of truck trips (integer ≥ 0, measured in trips)
- Let NumTrips["1"] be the number of van trips (integer ≥ 0, measured in trips)
- Let NumVehicles["0"] be the number of trucks used (integer ≥ 0, measured in vehicles)
- Let NumVehicles["1"] be the number of vans used (integer ≥ 0, measured in vehicles)
  (Note: Since each trip uses one vehicle, we have NumVehicles["0"] = NumTrips["0"] and NumVehicles["1"] = NumTrips["1"].)

Objective:
- Minimize total trips = NumTrips["0"] + NumTrips["1"]

Constraints:
1. Shipping capacity constraint (patties shipped must meet or exceed demand):
   1000 * NumTrips["0"] + 500 * NumTrips["1"] ≥ 50000
2. Budget constraint (total shipping cost must not exceed the available budget):
   300 * NumTrips["0"] + 100 * NumTrips["1"] ≤ 12500
3. Vehicle routing constraint (number of truck trips must not exceed number of van trips):
   NumTrips["0"] ≤ NumTrips["1"]

Comments:
- All costs are in USD per trip and capacities in patties per trip.
- The demand and budget constraints use totals over all trips.
- Although the model defines both NumTrips and NumVehicles, they represent the same counts since every trip uses one vehicle.
- Decision variables are integers, as fractional trips are not allowed.

--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Sets:
- P: set of processes = {J, P}

Parameters:
- metal_p: amount of metal extracted per operation of process p [units of metal]
  • metal_J = 5, metal_P = 9
- water_p: water used per operation of process p [units of water]
  • water_J = 8, water_P = 6
- pollution_p: pollution produced per operation of process p [units of pollution]
  • pollution_J = 3, pollution_P = 5
- max_water: maximum available water [units of water] = 1500
- max_pollution: maximum allowed pollution [units of pollution] = 1350

Variables:
- x_p: number of operations to perform for process p [real number ≥ 0]
  • x_J: operations under process J (can be nonnegative float; if process counts must be integer, then restrict accordingly)
  • x_P: operations under process P (can be nonnegative float; if process counts must be integer, then restrict accordingly)
  
(In the expected output schema, these are represented as ProcessUnit { "0": x_J, "1": x_P } with float values.)

Objective:
- Maximize total metal extracted defined as:
  TotalMetal = metal_J * x_J + metal_P * x_P
  (Units: units of metal)

Constraints:
1. Water usage constraint:
   water_J * x_J + water_P * x_P ≤ max_water
   (8 * x_J + 6 * x_P ≤ 1500)

2. Pollution constraint:
   pollution_J * x_J + pollution_P * x_P ≤ max_pollution
   (3 * x_J + 5 * x_P ≤ 1350)

Note: All parameters are in consistent units as described (units of water, metal, and pollution). The model assumes that process counts (x_J and x_P) can be fractional; if only whole process operations are allowed, then x_J and x_P should be declared as integer variables.

........................................................................................................................
--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Below is the complete mathematical model using the five‐element framework. In this model, all ship counts are assumed to be nonnegative integers, container capacities are in “containers per ship,” and the contract requirement is in “containers.” Note that the port limitation is modeled by requiring that the number of large ships does not exceed the number of small ships.

───────────────────────────── 
Sets:
- S = {Large, Small} 
  (A set that distinguishes the two types of ships)

───────────────────────────── 
Parameters:
- capacity_Large = 500   [containers per large ship]
- capacity_Small = 200   [containers per small ship]
- minRequiredContainers = 3000   [containers]
- Note: The “port constraint” is given by the condition that the number of large ships cannot exceed the number of small ships.

───────────────────────────── 
Variables:
- NumberLargeShips: number of large ships to use (integer, ≥ 0)
- NumberSmallShips: number of small ships to use (integer, ≥ 0)

───────────────────────────── 
Objective:
- Minimize TotalShips  where TotalShips = NumberLargeShips + NumberSmallShips
  (This minimizes the overall number of ships used.)

───────────────────────────── 
Constraints:
1. Container Transport Capability:
  500 * NumberLargeShips + 200 * NumberSmallShips ≥ 3000
  (This constraint ensures that at least 3000 containers can be transported.)

2. Port Size Constraint:
  NumberLargeShips ≤ NumberSmallShips
  (This reflects that “most ports are small” and limits the use of large ships.)

───────────────────────────── 

Below is the final output following the expected output schema:

{
  "variables": {
    "NumberLargeShips": "integer >= 0 (number of large ships)",
    "NumberSmallShips": "integer >= 0 (number of small ships)"

Since sleeping pills are more popular, at least 70% of the pills should be sleeping pills. How many of each should the pharmacy make to minimize the total amount of digestive medicine needed?

--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Sets:
- PillTypes = {Painkiller, Sleeping}

Parameters:
- totalMorphineAvailable = 3000 mg (total morphine available)
- morphinePerPainkiller = 10 mg (morphine needed per painkiller)
- morphinePerSleeping = 6 mg (morphine needed per sleeping pill)
- digestiveMedPerPainkiller = 3 units (digestive medicine needed per painkiller)
- digestiveMedPerSleeping = 5 units (digestive medicine needed per sleeping pill)
- minPainkillers = 50 (minimum number of painkiller pills required)
- minSleepingRatio = 0.70 (sleeping pills must be at least 70% of total pills)

Variables:
- PainkillerPills: number of painkiller pills to produce [nonnegative integer, units: pills]
- SleepingPills: number of sleeping pills to produce [nonnegative integer, units: pills]

Objective:
- Minimize total digestive medicine used, calculated as:
  TotalDigestiveMedicine = digestiveMedPerPainkiller * PainkillerPills + digestiveMedPerSleeping * SleepingPills

Constraints:
1. Morphine Constraint:
   morphinePerPainkiller * PainkillerPills + morphinePerSleeping * SleepingPills <= totalMorphineAvailable
   (i.e., 10 * PainkillerPills + 6 * SleepingPills <= 3000)

2. Minimum Painkiller Production:
   PainkillerPills >= minPainkillers
   (i.e., PainkillerPills >= 50)

3. Sleeping Pills Minimum Ratio:
   The fraction of sleeping pills among total pills must be at least 70%. This can be written as:
   SleepingPills >= minSleepingRatio * (PainkillerPills + SleepingPills)
   Rearranging the inequality:
   SleepingPills - 0.7 * SleepingPills >= 0.7 * PainkillerPills
   0.3 * SleepingPills >= 0.7 * PainkillerPills
   Thus, SleepingPills >= (0.7 / 0.3) * PainkillerPills  or equivalently SleepingPills >= (7/3) * PainkillerPills

Model Summary in Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "PainkillerPills": "integer, number of painkiller pills to produce [pills]",
    "SleepingPills": "integer, number of sleeping pills to produce [pills]"
  },
  "objective": "Minimize digestive medicine = 3 * PainkillerPills + 5 * SleepingPills"
}

Notes:
- All units are consistent with the problem description.
- Decision variables are defined as integers since you cannot produce fractional pills.
- The sleeping pills ratio inequality has been reformulated for ease of implementation.
- This model minimizes the total digestive medicine required, subject to morphine availability, a minimum production threshold for painkillers, and the requirement that sleeping pills form at least 70% of the total production.

--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Sets:
- A: set of appliance types = {WashingMachine, Freezer}

Parameters:
- inspection_time_WM: inspection time per washing machine [minutes] = 30
- repair_time_WM: repair time per washing machine [minutes] = 90
- inspection_time_FR: inspection time per freezer [minutes] = 20
- repair_time_FR: repair time per freezer [minutes] = 125
- revenue_WM: revenue per washing machine repaired [USD] = 250
- revenue_FR: revenue per freezer repaired [USD] = 375
- max_inspection_time: total available inspection time [minutes] = 5000
- max_repair_time: total available repair time [minutes] = 20000

Variables:
- WashingMachinesInspected: number of washing machines inspected [nonnegative integer]
- WashingMachinesRepaired: number of washing machines repaired [nonnegative integer]
- FreezersInspected: number of freezers inspected [nonnegative integer]
- FreezersRepaired: number of freezers repaired [nonnegative integer]
  (Note: In this model it is assumed that an appliance must be inspected before it is repaired. Therefore, each washing machine (or freezer) that is repaired is also inspected.)

Objective:
- Maximize total revenue = (revenue_WM * WashingMachinesRepaired) + (revenue_FR * FreezersRepaired)

Constraints:
1. Inspection time constraint:
   30 * WashingMachinesInspected + 20 * FreezersInspected ≤ max_inspection_time

2. Repair time constraint:
   90 * WashingMachinesRepaired + 125 * FreezersRepaired ≤ max_repair_time

3. Synchronization constraints (inspection precedes repair):
   WashingMachinesInspected = WashingMachinesRepaired
   FreezersInspected = FreezersRepaired

Comments:
- All time parameters are in minutes and all revenue parameters are in US dollars per repaired appliance.
- The synchronization constraints reflect the assumption that each appliance fixed must be inspected first. If however the inspection process can extend to appliances that are not fixed, then these two pairs of variables might be decoupled and additional modeling of inspection-to-repair conversion would be required.
- The decision variables are modeled as nonnegative integers, though they are declared as floats in the expected schema; in an integer programming implementation, they would be integer-valued.

This complete model adheres to the five-element structure and is directly mappable to a working implementation in Python or OR-Tools.

--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Sets:
- Ingredient: A set representing the two types of lawn treatment inputs = {Fertilizer, Seeds}

Parameters:
- time_per_fertilizer: 0.5 (minutes per unit of Fertilizer)
- time_per_seeds: 1.5 (minutes per unit of Seeds)
- max_total_units: 300 (maximum combined units of Fertilizer and Seeds allowed)
- min_fertilizer_units: 50 (minimum units of Fertilizer required)
- fertilizer_to_seeds_ratio: 2 (Fertilizer units can be at most twice the Seeds units)

Variables:
- FertilizerUnits: continuous variable representing the number of Fertilizer units to add (units, ≥ 0)
- SeedsUnits: continuous variable representing the number of Seeds units to add (units, ≥ 0)
- TotalTime: continuous variable representing the total time required for the lawn to be ready (minutes)

Objective:
- Minimize TotalTime, which is computed as (time_per_fertilizer * FertilizerUnits) + (time_per_seeds * SeedsUnits)

Constraints:
1. Total Units Constraint: FertilizerUnits + SeedsUnits ≤ max_total_units  
   (Ensures that the combined units of inputs do not exceed 300 units)

2. Minimum Fertilizer Constraint: FertilizerUnits ≥ min_fertilizer_units  
   (Guarantees that at least 50 units of Fertilizer are added)

3. Fertilizer-to-Seeds Ratio Constraint: FertilizerUnits ≤ fertilizer_to_seeds_ratio * SeedsUnits  
   (Limits the Fertilizer to at most twice the number of Seeds)

Additional Model Comments:
- All units are assumed to be in the same measurement (units for inputs and minutes for time), ensuring consistency.  
- The decision variables are treated as continuous because fractional units may be acceptable unless the context requires integer amounts.  
- TotalTime is a calculated quantity that directly reflects the weighted sum of the units selected for each treatment input.

........................................................................................................................
--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Below is a complete formulation of the problem using the five-element modeling framework.

--------------------------------------------------

Sets:
• No explicit sets are needed since the decision is over two vehicle types (large and small). You can think of the vehicle types as an implicit set V = {Large, Small}.

Parameters:
• capacityLarge = 6           // Number of people that a large unit can transport [people/unit]
• capacitySmall = 2           // Number of people that a small unit can transport [people/unit]
• parkingLarge = 2            // Number of parking spots a large unit occupies [spots/unit]
• parkingSmall = 1            // Number of parking spots a small unit occupies [spots/unit]
• requiredPeople = 80         // Total number of people that must be transported [people]
• minSmallUnits = 5           // Minimum number of small mobile units required [units]
• minLargeFraction = 0.75     // Minimum required fraction of large units among all vehicles [dimensionless]

Variables:
• LargeUnits: number of large mobile production units used [integer, ≥ 0]
• SmallUnits: number of small mobile production units used [integer, ≥ 0]

Note: We assume that vehicles are integer quantities. If fractional vehicles are considered (e.g., for planning relaxations), change the type accordingly.

Objective:
• Minimize total parking spots required.
  Expressed as: Minimize TotalParking = parkingLarge * LargeUnits + parkingSmall * SmallUnits
  [Objective: minimize spots (units: spots)]

Constraints:
1. People transport capacity:
   capacityLarge * LargeUnits + capacitySmall * SmallUnits ≥ requiredPeople
   (Ensures that the chosen fleet can transport at least 80 people.)

2. Minimum small units requirement:
   SmallUnits ≥ minSmallUnits
   (At least 5 small units must be used.)

3. Large unit fleet composition constraint:
   The large units must be at least 75% of all vehicles. In equation form:
   LargeUnits / (LargeUnits + SmallUnits) ≥ minLargeFraction
   This inequality can be rearranged (assuming LargeUnits + SmallUnits > 0) to:
   LargeUnits ≥ (minLargeFraction / (1 - minLargeFraction)) * SmallUnits
   With minLargeFraction = 0.75, note that (0.75 / (1-0.75)) = 3, so this constraint becomes:
   LargeUnits ≥ 3 * SmallUnits

--------------------------------------------------

The following JSON schema summarizes the key decision variables and the objective value:

{
  "variables": {
    "NumberLargeUnits": "integer (≥ 0)",
    "NumberSmallUnits": "integer (≥ 0)"
  },
  "objective": "Total parking spots used = 2 * NumberLargeUnits + 1 * NumberSmallUnits"
}

--------------------------------------------------

This formulation is now complete, self-contained, and fully reflects the requirements stated in the original problem.

Below is the structured mathematical model using the five-element framework.

--------------------------------------------------

Sets:
- T: set of thermometer types = {Electronic, Regular}

Parameters:
- time_electronic: time required for one electronic reading [minutes] = 3
- time_regular: time required for one regular reading [minutes] = 2
- total_available_time: total minutes the office is open [minutes] = 15000
- min_regular_readings: minimum number of regular readings [patients] = 50
- ratio_requirement: minimum ratio of electronic to regular readings [dimensionless] = 2  
  (Interpretation: The number of electronic readings must be at least twice the number of regular readings.)

Variables:
- ElectronicReadings (E): number of patients whose temperature is taken with the electronic thermometer [integer ≥ 0]
- RegularReadings (R): number of patients whose temperature is taken with the regular thermometer [integer ≥ 0]

Objective:
- Maximize TotalPatients = ElectronicReadings + RegularReadings

Constraints:
1. Time Constraint:  
   3 * ElectronicReadings + 2 * RegularReadings ≤ total_available_time  
   (Ensures that the sum of time spent on all readings does not exceed 15000 minutes.)

2. Ratio Constraint:  
   ElectronicReadings ≥ ratio_requirement * RegularReadings  
   (Ensures that there are at least twice as many electronic readings as regular readings.)

3. Minimum Regular Constraint:  
   RegularReadings ≥ min_regular_readings  
   (Ensures that at least 50 patients are checked with the regular thermometer.)

--------------------------------------------------

Additional Comments:
- All time parameters are in minutes, and the number of readings represents individual patients.
- While the decision variables are defined as integers since they represent patient counts, they can be modeled as continuous variables if rounding is applied.
- The objective is to maximize the total number of patients whose temperature is checked within the available time.
