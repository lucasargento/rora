Problem description: A pharmaceutical company makes skin cream in batches, a regular batch and premium batch, to sell to hospitals. The regular batch requires 50 units of medicinal ingredients and 40 units of rehydration product. A premium batch requires 40 units of medicinal ingredients and 60 units of rehydration product. The company has available 3000 units of medicinal ingredients and 3500 units of rehydration product. Since the premium batch sells better, the number of regular batches must be less than the number of premium batches. In addition, the company must make at least 10 regular batches. If a regular batch can treat 50 people and a premium batch can treat 30 people, how many of each batch should be made to maximize the number of people that can be treated?

--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Sets:
- Batches: a set with two elements {Regular, Premium} representing the two types of skin cream batches.

Parameters:
- medicinal_req_regular: 50 (units of medicinal ingredients needed per regular batch)
- medicinal_req_premium: 40 (units of medicinal ingredients needed per premium batch)
- rehydration_req_regular: 40 (units of rehydration product needed per regular batch)
- rehydration_req_premium: 60 (units of rehydration product needed per premium batch)
- medicinal_avail: 3000 (total available units of medicinal ingredients)
- rehydration_avail: 3500 (total available units of rehydration product)
- treats_regular: 50 (number of people treated by one regular batch)
- treats_premium: 30 (number of people treated by one premium batch)
- min_regular_batches: 10 (minimum number of regular batches that must be produced)
- note: All units are assumed consistent (ingredients and treated people per batch).

Variables:
- x_regular: number of regular batches produced [integer ≥ 0]
- x_premium: number of premium batches produced [integer ≥ 0]

Objective:
Maximize total people treated:
   maximize_total_people = treats_regular * x_regular + treats_premium * x_premium
   i.e., maximize 50 * x_regular + 30 * x_premium

Constraints:
1. Medicinal ingredient constraint:
   medicinal_req_regular * x_regular + medicinal_req_premium * x_premium ≤ medicinal_avail
   i.e., 50 * x_regular + 40 * x_premium ≤ 3000

2. Rehydration product constraint:
   rehydration_req_regular * x_regular + rehydration_req_premium * x_premium ≤ rehydration_avail
   i.e., 40 * x_regular + 60 * x_premium ≤ 3500

3. Batch comparison constraint (regular batches must be less than premium batches):
   x_regular < x_premium

4. Minimum production requirement for regular batches:
   x_regular ≥ min_regular_batches
   i.e., x_regular ≥ 10

5. Domain of decision variables:
   x_regular and x_premium are non-negative integers.

This complete model provides a clear mapping from the problem description into the five-element mathematical optimization formulation.

--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Below is one valid formulation using the five-element structured model.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Sets:
- M: set of machines = {1, 2}

Parameters:
- eyeProd[1] = 30      (ml of eye cream produced per hour by machine 1)
- eyeProd[2] = 45      (ml of eye cream produced per hour by machine 2)
- footProd[1] = 60     (ml of foot cream produced per hour by machine 1)
- footProd[2] = 30     (ml of foot cream produced per hour by machine 2)
- waterUse[1] = 20     (ml of water consumed per hour by machine 1)
- waterUse[2] = 15     (ml of water consumed per hour by machine 2)

- minEyeCream = 1300   (minimum required ml of eye cream)
- minFootCream = 1500  (minimum required ml of foot cream)
- availWater = 1200    (total available ml of distilled water)

Comments:
- All production numbers are in milliliters (ml) per hour.
- Operating times are measured in hours.
- The water constraint uses the same unit (ml).

Variables:
- OperatingTime[i] for each machine i in M, where OperatingTime[i] is a continuous variable representing the number of hours machine i is used.
  • OperatingTime[1] ≥ 0
  • OperatingTime[2] ≥ 0

Objective:
- Minimize TotalTime = OperatingTime[1] + OperatingTime[2]
  (This minimizes the total machine operating time in hours.)

Constraints:
1. Eye Cream Production Constraint:
   - eyeProd[1] * OperatingTime[1] + eyeProd[2] * OperatingTime[2] ≥ minEyeCream
   - (30 * OperatingTime[1] + 45 * OperatingTime[2] ≥ 1300)

2. Foot Cream Production Constraint:
   - footProd[1] * OperatingTime[1] + footProd[2] * OperatingTime[2] ≥ minFootCream
   - (60 * OperatingTime[1] + 30 * OperatingTime[2] ≥ 1500)

3. Water Availability Constraint:
   - waterUse[1] * OperatingTime[1] + waterUse[2] * OperatingTime[2] ≤ availWater
   - (20 * OperatingTime[1] + 15 * OperatingTime[2] ≤ 1200)

--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Sets:
- Product: set of office products = {Desk, Drawer}

Parameters:
- profit_desk: profit per desk (USD/unit) = 100
- profit_drawer: profit per drawer (USD/unit) = 90
- assembly_time_desk: assembly time required per desk (minutes/unit) = 40
- assembly_time_drawer: assembly time required per drawer (minutes/unit) = 30
- sanding_time_desk: sanding time required per desk (minutes/unit) = 20
- sanding_time_drawer: sanding time required per drawer (minutes/unit) = 10
- max_assembly_time: total available assembly time (minutes) = 4000
- max_sanding_time: total available sanding time (minutes) = 3500

Variables:
- x_desk: number of desks to produce (float ≥ 0) [units]
- x_drawer: number of drawers to produce (float ≥ 0) [units]

Objective:
- Maximize total profit = (profit_desk * x_desk) + (profit_drawer * x_drawer)
  (This equals 100 * x_desk + 90 * x_drawer)

Constraints:
1. Assembly time constraint: (assembly_time_desk * x_desk) + (assembly_time_drawer * x_drawer) ≤ max_assembly_time  
   (i.e., 40 * x_desk + 30 * x_drawer ≤ 4000)
2. Sanding time constraint: (sanding_time_desk * x_desk) + (sanding_time_drawer * x_drawer) ≤ max_sanding_time  
   (i.e., 20 * x_desk + 10 * x_drawer ≤ 3500)
3. Non-negativity constraints: x_desk ≥ 0 and x_drawer ≥ 0

Additional Comments:
- All time parameters are expressed in minutes, and capacity constraints are given in minutes.
- Profits are in USD per unit produced.
- Although production counts are typically integer, the expected output schema declares the decision variables as float.
  
This completes the structured mathematical model using the five-element framework.

Sets:
- BottleTypes = {Small, Large}

Parameters:
- capacity_small: honey capacity per small bottle [units] = 5
- capacity_large: honey capacity per large bottle [units] = 20
- max_small: maximum available small bottles [bottles] = 300
- max_large: maximum available large bottles [bottles] = 100
- max_total_bottles: maximum total bottles that can be transported [bottles] = 200
- min_large_used: minimum large bottles to use [bottles] = 50
- small_to_large_ratio: minimum ratio of small bottles to large bottles = 2  (i.e., number of small bottles used must be at least twice the number of large bottles used)

Variables:
- x_small: number of small bottles to use [integer, units = bottles]
- x_large: number of large bottles to use [integer, units = bottles]

Objective:
- Maximize total honey transported = (capacity_small * x_small) + (capacity_large * x_large)

Constraints:
1. Availability constraints:
   - x_small <= max_small
   - x_large <= max_large

2. Total bottle constraint:
   - x_small + x_large <= max_total_bottles

3. Ratio constraint:
   - x_small >= small_to_large_ratio * x_large

4. Minimum large bottle usage constraint:
   - x_large >= min_large_used

Comments:
- All decision variables are assumed to be integer since the number of bottles must be whole numbers.
- The units for capacities are in "units of honey" (e.g., liters, kilograms) as described in the problem but no specific unit was provided.
- This model maximizes the total transported honey subject to the available bottle counts and additional constraints.

........................................................................................................................
--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Sets:
- TeaTypes: set of milk tea types = {black, matcha}

Parameters:
- profit_black: profit per bottle of black milk tea [USD per bottle] = 7.5
- profit_matcha: profit per bottle of matcha milk tea [USD per bottle] = 5
- milk_black: milk required per bottle of black milk tea [grams per bottle] = 600
- milk_matcha: milk required per bottle of matcha milk tea [grams per bottle] = 525
- honey_black: honey required per bottle of black milk tea [grams per bottle] = 10
- honey_matcha: honey required per bottle of matcha milk tea [grams per bottle] = 5
- total_milk: total available milk [grams] = 30000
- total_honey: total available honey [grams] = 500

Variables:
- x_black: number of bottles of black milk tea to produce [nonnegative continuous variable, representing bottles]
- x_matcha: number of bottles of matcha milk tea to produce [nonnegative continuous variable, representing bottles]
  (Note: Even though bottles are discrete, the problem formulation uses floats. In a practical implementation, you might require integer variables.)

Objective:
- Maximize total profit:
  Maximize Profit = (profit_black * x_black) + (profit_matcha * x_matcha)
  which numerically is: Maximize Profit = 7.5*x_black + 5*x_matcha

Constraints:
1. Milk availability constraint:
   milk_black*x_black + milk_matcha*x_matcha ≤ total_milk
   That is: 600*x_black + 525*x_matcha ≤ 30000

2. Honey availability constraint:
   honey_black*x_black + honey_matcha*x_matcha ≤ total_honey
   That is: 10*x_black + 5*x_matcha ≤ 500

# Model Comments:
- All resource units are expressed in grams for milk and honey.
- The decision variables represent the number of bottles produced; while bottles are discrete, the variable type is indicated as float per the expected output schema.
- The objective focuses solely on profit maximization with no additional cost elements.

This structured mathematical model is complete and faithfully represents the original milk tea optimization problem using the five-element framework.

--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Sets:
- M: set of transportation methods = {Cart, Trolley}

Parameters:
- capacity_cart = 5        // Equipment delivered per cart in kg per minute
- capacity_trolley = 7     // Equipment delivered per trolley in kg per minute
- workers_cart = 2         // Workers required per cart
- workers_trolley = 4      // Workers required per trolley
- required_delivery = 100  // Total required delivery rate in kg per minute
- min_trolleys = 12        // At least 12 trolleys must be used
- max_trolley_share = 0.4  // Maximum share (40%) of total delivery that can come from trolleys

Variables:
- NumberOfCarts, representing the number of carts used [decision variable, continuous (or integer if enforced) and ≥ 0]
- NumberOfTrolleys, representing the number of trolleys used [decision variable, continuous (or integer if enforced) and ≥ 0]

Objective:
- Minimize total workers required = workers_cart * NumberOfCarts + workers_trolley * NumberOfTrolleys

Constraints:
1. Delivery Requirement: 
   capacity_cart * NumberOfCarts + capacity_trolley * NumberOfTrolleys ≥ required_delivery
   (i.e., 5 * NumberOfCarts + 7 * NumberOfTrolleys ≥ 100)

2. Minimum Trolley Usage:
   NumberOfTrolleys ≥ min_trolleys
   (i.e., NumberOfTrolleys ≥ 12)

3. Trolley Share Limitation:
   The equipment delivered by trolleys may not exceed max_trolley_share of the total equipment delivered. That is,
   capacity_trolley * NumberOfTrolleys ≤ max_trolley_share * (capacity_cart * NumberOfCarts + capacity_trolley * NumberOfTrolleys)
   (i.e., 7 * NumberOfTrolleys ≤ 0.4 * (5 * NumberOfCarts + 7 * NumberOfTrolleys))

Comments:
- All rates and capacities are given in kg per minute and workers per vehicle.
- Although the decision variables could be naturally integer, the output schema indicates their type as "float". Adjust integrality constraints as needed in implementation.
- The third constraint ensures that at most 40% of the total transportation (by kg/min) is provided by trolleys.

........................................................................................................................
--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Below is a complete and unambiguous mathematical model using the five-element structure.

--------------------------------------------------
Sets:
- P: set of chocolate bar types = {Milk, Dark}

--------------------------------------------------
Parameters:
- Cocoa_per_Milk: cocoa units required per milk chocolate bar = 4 [units/bar]
- Cocoa_per_Dark: cocoa units required per dark chocolate bar = 6 [units/bar]
- Milk_per_Milk: milk units required per milk chocolate bar = 7 [units/bar]
- Milk_per_Dark: milk units required per dark chocolate bar = 3 [units/bar]
- Total_Cocoa: total available cocoa = 2000 [units]
- Total_Milk: total available milk = 1750 [units]
- Time_Milk: production time per milk chocolate bar = 15 [minutes/bar]
- Time_Dark: production time per dark chocolate bar = 12 [minutes/bar]
- Ratio_Min: minimum ratio of milk chocolate bars to dark chocolate bars = 2 [milk bars per dark bar]

--------------------------------------------------
Variables:
- MilkBars: number of milk chocolate bars produced [nonnegative integer; units: bars]
- DarkBars: number of dark chocolate bars produced [nonnegative integer; units: bars]

--------------------------------------------------
Objective:
- Minimize total production time = (Time_Milk * MilkBars) + (Time_Dark * DarkBars)
  which translates to: Minimize 15 * MilkBars + 12 * DarkBars [minutes]

--------------------------------------------------
Constraints:
1. Cocoa availability constraint:
   4 * MilkBars + 6 * DarkBars ≤ 2000
   (Total cocoa used by both types cannot exceed available cocoa.)

2. Milk availability constraint:
   7 * MilkBars + 3 * DarkBars ≤ 1750
   (Total milk used by both types cannot exceed available milk.)

3. Production ratio constraint:
   MilkBars ≥ 2 * DarkBars
   (At least two milk chocolate bars must be produced for every dark chocolate bar.)

--------------------------------------------------

Additional Comments:
- All units are clearly stated in the parameter definitions.
- Decision variables are assumed to be integers since they represent countable bars. However, if divisibility is acceptable (or for relaxation purposes), they may be treated as continuous nonnegative variables.
- The model is self-contained and avoids duplications by directly referencing parameters in constraints and the objective.
- This complete formulation can be directly mapped to code using Python or OR-Tools.

Below is the structured mathematical model following the five-element format.

--------------------------------------------------

Sets:
- ShipType = {Large, Small}

Parameters:
- LargeCapacity = 2000 (number of customers per large cruise trip)
- SmallCapacity = 800 (number of customers per small cruise trip)
- LargePollution = 20 (pollution units produced per large cruise trip)
- SmallPollution = 15 (pollution units produced per small cruise trip)
- MaxLargeTrips = 7 (maximum allowable number of large cruise trips)
- MinTotalCustomers = 20000 (minimum total number of customers to be transported)
- MinSmallFraction = 0.4 (minimum fraction of total trips that must be small cruise trips)
  (Note: The small-ship requirement implies that the number of small trips must be at least 0.4 times the total trips.)

Variables:
- NumberLargeTrips [integer, ≥ 0]: Number of large cruise ship trips to schedule (units: trips)
- NumberSmallTrips [integer, ≥ 0]: Number of small cruise ship trips to schedule (units: trips)

Objective:
- Minimize total pollution produced:
  TotalPollution = LargePollution * NumberLargeTrips + SmallPollution * NumberSmallTrips

Constraints:
1. Customer Requirement Constraint:
   LargeCapacity * NumberLargeTrips + SmallCapacity * NumberSmallTrips ≥ MinTotalCustomers

2. Maximum Large Trips Constraint:
   NumberLargeTrips ≤ MaxLargeTrips

3. Minimum Small Trip Fraction Constraint:
   To ensure at least 40% of all trips are small trips, we enforce:
   NumberSmallTrips ≥ MinSmallFraction * (NumberLargeTrips + NumberSmallTrips)
   (Note: This inequality is equivalent to NumberSmallTrips ≥ (2/3) * NumberLargeTrips.)

4. Non-negativity Constraints:
   NumberLargeTrips ≥ 0  
   NumberSmallTrips ≥ 0

This complete model can now be implemented in a mathematical optimization framework where the decision variables and parameters are as described.

Sets:
- Chem: set of chemicals = {A, B}

Parameters:
- time_per_unit_A: Time required for one unit of chemical A to be effective [seconds per unit] = 30
- time_per_unit_B: Time required for one unit of chemical B to be effective [seconds per unit] = 45

- min_A: Minimum required units of chemical A [units] = 300
- min_total: Minimum required total units of chemicals A and B [units] = 1500

Variables:
- QuantityChemicalA: Number of units of chemical A to add [continuous, ≥ 0, units]
- QuantityChemicalB: Number of units of chemical B to add [continuous, ≥ 0, units]

Objective:
- Minimize total_mixing_time = (time_per_unit_A * QuantityChemicalA) + (time_per_unit_B * QuantityChemicalB)
  [Total mixing time in seconds]

Constraints:
1. Safety constraint: QuantityChemicalA ≤ safe_ratio * QuantityChemicalB
   (Ensures that chemical A does not exceed one third the amount of chemical B.)
2. Minimum chemical A requirement: QuantityChemicalA ≥ min_A
3. Total chemical requirement: QuantityChemicalA + QuantityChemicalB ≥ min_total

Comments:
- All units are assumed to be consistent (units for chemicals, seconds for time).  
- The objective is to reduce the overall mixing time while respecting safety and minimum quantity constraints.  
- Both decision variables are modeled as continuous, but if the application requires discrete units, they could be redefined as integers.

--> Problem Description
Problem description: A food truck owner can spend at most $20000 on mangos and guavas. A mango costs the food truck owner $5 and a guava costs him $3. Spices are added and each mango is sold for a profit of $3 while each guava is sold for a profit of $4. The owner estimates that at least 100 mangos but at the most 150 are sold each month. He also estimates that the number of guavas sold is at most a third of the mangos sold. How many mangos and guavas should be sold in order to maximize the profit?

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "variables": {
    "QuantityMango": "float",
    "QuantityGuava": "float",
    "MangosSold": "float",
    "GuavasSold": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}
........................................................................................................................
--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Below is a complete five‐element formulation that stays true to the problem details. Note that in this model we assume that the number of fruits purchased equals the number sold so that QuantityMango equals MangosSold and QuantityGuava equals GuavasSold. You can later choose to treat them as separate decisions if the problem’s business logic requires it.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Sets:
• Fruits = {Mango, Guava}

-----------------------------------------------------------
Parameters:
• max_budget = 20000  
  – The maximum dollars available to spend on fruits.
• cost_Mango = 5  
  – The cost in dollars per mango.
• cost_Guava = 3  
  – The cost in dollars per guava.
• profit_Mango = 3  
  – The profit in dollars earned from selling one mango.
• profit_Guava = 4  
  – The profit in dollars earned from selling one guava.
• min_mangos_sold = 100  
  – The minimum number of mangos that must be sold each month.
• max_mangos_sold = 150  
  – The maximum number of mangos that can be sold each month.
• guava_ratio = 1/3  
  – Guavas sold cannot exceed one third of the number of mangos sold.
   (Interpretation: GuavasSold ≤ (1/3) × MangosSold)

-----------------------------------------------------------
Variables:
• MangosSold  
  – Number of mangos sold [integer, units]  
• GuavasSold  
  – Number of guavas sold [integer, units]  
• QuantityMango  
  – Total number of mangos purchased [float]; in this model we set QuantityMango = MangosSold.
• QuantityGuava  
  – Total number of guavas purchased [float]; here QuantityGuava = GuavasSold.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Objective:
Maximize profit, defined as:
  Total Profit = profit_Mango × MangosSold + profit_Guava × GuavasSold  
  or equivalently, maximize 3 × MangosSold + 4 × GuavasSold.
  (This formulation assumes profit is calculated after accounting for the cost of spices; only the per-unit profits of fruits are used here as per the problem description.)

-----------------------------------------------------------
Constraints:
1. Budget Constraint:  
  cost_Mango × MangosSold + cost_Guava × GuavasSold ≤ max_budget  
  In expression form: 5 × MangosSold + 3 × GuavasSold ≤ 20000  
  (Unit: dollars)

2. Mango Sales Range:  
  min_mangos_sold ≤ MangosSold ≤ max_mangos_sold  
  That is, 100 ≤ MangosSold ≤ 150

3. Guava Sales Ratio Constraint:  
  GuavasSold ≤ guava_ratio × MangosSold  
  That is, GuavasSold ≤ (1/3) × MangosSold

-----------------------------------------------------------
Comments:
• All cost and profit parameters are in U.S. dollars per unit, and all sales numbers are expressed in units.  
• The assumption that QuantityMango equals MangosSold (and similarly for guavas) is made since the problem does not distinguish between purchase quantity and sold quantity.  
• Decision variables are assumed to be nonnegative integers, although they are marked as floats in the expected output schema. This choice can be adapted if fractional sales are acceptable in a relaxed model.

This structured model conforms to the five-element framework and is ready for implementation in OR-Tools or similar optimization libraries.

........................................................................................................................
--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Below is the structured mathematical model for the problem using the five‐element framework.

------------------------------------------------
Sets:
• B = {1, 2}  
  (Beaker types: 1 for beaker 1 and 2 for beaker 2)

------------------------------------------------
Parameters:
• flour_b: units of flour used per experiment with beaker b  
  – flour_1 = 4 units per use (beaker 1)  
  – flour_2 = 6 units per use (beaker 2)

• liquid_b: units of special liquid used per experiment with beaker b  
  – liquid_1 = 6 units per use (beaker 1)  
  – liquid_2 = 3 units per use (beaker 2)

• slime_b: units of slime produced per experiment with beaker b  
  – slime_1 = 5 units per use (beaker 1)  
  – slime_2 = 3 units per use (beaker 2)

• waste_b: units of waste produced per experiment with beaker b  
  – waste_1 = 4 units per use (beaker 1)  
  – waste_2 = 2 units per use (beaker 2)

• resource limits (all units are consistent with the given descriptions):  
  – total_flour = 150 units  
  – total_liquid = 100 units  
  – max_waste = 30 units

------------------------------------------------
Variables:
• x_b for b in B, where:
  – x_1 = number of times beaker 1 is used  
  – x_2 = number of times beaker 2 is used  
 Domain: x_b ∈ {0, 1, 2, …} (nonnegative integers)  
  (Note: we assume each usage represents one complete experiment with the beaker)

------------------------------------------------
Objective:
Maximize total slime production (in units) given by:
 TotalSlime = slime_1 * x_1 + slime_2 * x_2  
In other words, maximize 5 * x_1 + 3 * x_2

------------------------------------------------
Constraints:
1. Flour Constraint:  
  flour_1 * x_1 + flour_2 * x_2 ≤ total_flour  
  i.e., 4 * x_1 + 6 * x_2 ≤ 150

2. Special Liquid Constraint:  
  liquid_1 * x_1 + liquid_2 * x_2 ≤ total_liquid  
  i.e., 6 * x_1 + 3 * x_2 ≤ 100

3. Waste Constraint:  
  waste_1 * x_1 + waste_2 * x_2 ≤ max_waste  
  i.e., 4 * x_1 + 2 * x_2 ≤ 30

------------------------------------------------
Notes and Assumptions:
• All resource usage and production values are in “units” as stated in the problem.  
• The decision variables (x_1 and x_2) are assumed to be integer because you cannot use a beaker a fractional number of times.  
• The formulation is directly based on the real-world description with no data simplification or transformation.  

This model is now complete and ready for implementation in a tool such as OR-Tools.

........................................................................................................................
--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Sets:
- V: set of van types = {Regular, Hybrid}

Parameters:
- delivery_capacity[v] (packages per day): delivery_capacity[Regular] = 500, delivery_capacity[Hybrid] = 300
- pollutant_emission[v] (pollutant units per day): pollutant_emission[Regular] = 200, pollutant_emission[Hybrid] = 100
- max_pollutants (pollutant units per day) = 7000
- min_packages (packages per day) = 20000

Variables:
- x[v]: number of vans to purchase of type v (integer, nonnegative)
  - x[Regular]: number of regular vans
  - x[Hybrid]: number of hybrid vans

Objective:
- Minimize total vans = x[Regular] + x[Hybrid]

Constraints:
- Package delivery constraint: delivery_capacity[Regular] * x[Regular] + delivery_capacity[Hybrid] * x[Hybrid] >= min_packages
- Pollutant constraint: pollutant_emission[Regular] * x[Regular] + pollutant_emission[Hybrid] * x[Hybrid] <= max_pollutants

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Comments:
- All units are per day.
- Both decision variables are assumed integer though they are represented as float in the expected output schema.
- The model assumes each van works at full capacity every day.
- Alternative interpretation:
   If the van numbers are allowed to be fractional (due to leasing or averaging over days), then the variables can be continuous. Otherwise, they should be integer.

........................................................................................................................
--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Below is the complete five‐element model for the Elm Furniture production problem.

------------------------------------------------------------
Sets:
- P: set of products = {Chair, Dresser}

------------------------------------------------------------
Parameters:
- profit_Chair: profit per chair produced [$ per chair] = 43
- profit_Dresser: profit per dresser produced [$ per dresser] = 52
- stain_available: total gallons of stain available per week [gallons] = 17
- oak_available: total lengths of oak wood available per week [lengths] = 11
- stain_required_Chair: gallons of stain required per chair [gallons/chair] = 1.4
- stain_required_Dresser: gallons of stain required per dresser [gallons/dresser] = 1.1
- oak_required_Chair: lengths of oak wood required per chair [lengths/chair] = 2
- oak_required_Dresser: lengths of oak wood required per dresser [lengths/dresser] = 3

------------------------------------------------------------
Variables:
- NumberOfChairs: number of chairs to produce [nonnegative continuous, measured in units]
- NumberOfDressers: number of dressers to produce [nonnegative continuous, measured in units]

------------------------------------------------------------
Objective:
- Maximize Total Profit = (profit_Chair * NumberOfChairs) + (profit_Dresser * NumberOfDressers)

------------------------------------------------------------
Constraints:
1. Stain Constraint: (stain_required_Chair * NumberOfChairs) + (stain_required_Dresser * NumberOfDressers) ≤ stain_available  
   (This ensures the weekly consumption of stain does not exceed 17 gallons.)

2. Oak Wood Constraint: (oak_required_Chair * NumberOfChairs) + (oak_required_Dresser * NumberOfDressers) ≤ oak_available  
   (This ensures the weekly consumption of oak wood does not exceed 11 lengths.)

------------------------------------------------------------
Note:
- We assume that the production quantities can be fractional (as indicated by “float” in the expected output). If only whole units are feasible, then NumberOfChairs and NumberOfDressers should be declared as integers.
- All units have been consistently assigned based on the problem description.

--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Below is a precise formulation of the problem using the five-element structure:

------------------------------------------------------------
Sets:
- F: set of factories = {1, 2}
- B: set of bear colors = {black, white, brown}

------------------------------------------------------------
Parameters:
- cost[f]: production cost per hour for factory f (in USD/hour). Namely, cost[1] = 300, cost[2] = 600.
- prod[f, b]: number of bears of color b produced per hour in factory f.
  - For factory 1: prod[1, black] = 5, prod[1, white] = 6, prod[1, brown] = 3.
  - For factory 2: prod[2, black] = 10, prod[2, white] = 10, prod[2, brown] = 0.
- demand[b]: minimum number of bears that must be produced daily for each color.
  - demand[black] = 20, demand[white] = 5, demand[brown] = 15.

------------------------------------------------------------
Variables:
- x[f]: running time of factory f (in hours). Here x[1] and x[2] are continuous variables with x[f] >= 0.
  (The variable x[f] represents the number of hours factory f is operated.)

------------------------------------------------------------
Objective:
- Minimize total production cost.
  That is, minimize Z = sum over f in F of (cost[f] * x[f]).
  In this problem: Z = 300*x[1] + 600*x[2].

------------------------------------------------------------
Constraints:
For each bear color b in B, the total production from both factories must meet or exceed the daily demand.
- For black bears: prod[1, black]*x[1] + prod[2, black]*x[2] >= demand[black]
  which becomes: 5*x[1] + 10*x[2] >= 20.
- For white bears: prod[1, white]*x[1] + prod[2, white]*x[2] >= demand[white]
  which becomes: 6*x[1] + 10*x[2] >= 5.
- For brown bears: prod[1, brown]*x[1] + prod[2, brown]*x[2] >= demand[brown]
  which becomes: 3*x[1] + 0*x[2] >= 15.

------------------------------------------------------------
Additional Notes:
- All production rates and costs are given per hour, ensuring consistency in units.
- The decision variables (x[1] and x[2]) are continuous, assuming that fractional hours of operation are allowed.
- The model is linear and minimizes the total operational costs while satisfying the daily production requirements.
- In implementation, one could map the factories with indices 0 and 1 if required (e.g., RunningTime{0} corresponds to x[1] and RunningTime{1} corresponds to x[2]).

This completes the structured linear programming model for the teddy bear production problem.

--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Below is the complete and structured mathematical optimization model using the five-element framework. This model is fully self-contained based on the provided problem data and requirements.

------------------------------------------------------------
Sets:
- Meals: the set of meal types = {Fish, Chicken}

------------------------------------------------------------
Parameters:
- protein_fish: protein per fish meal = 10 units [units of protein/meal]
- protein_chicken: protein per chicken meal = 15 units [units of protein/meal]
- iron_fish: iron per fish meal = 12 units [units of iron/meal]
- iron_chicken: iron per chicken meal = 8 units [units of iron/meal]
- fat_fish: fat per fish meal = 7 units [units of fat/meal]
- fat_chicken: fat per chicken meal = 10 units [units of fat/meal]
- protein_requirement: minimum required protein = 130 units [units of protein]
- iron_requirement: minimum required iron = 120 units [units of iron]
- chicken_to_fish_ratio: minimum ratio of chicken to fish meals = 2  
  (i.e., the number of chicken meals must be at least twice the number of fish meals)

------------------------------------------------------------
Variables:
- FishMeals: number of fish meals consumed [float, continuous, nonnegative]
- ChickenMeals: number of chicken meals consumed [float, continuous, nonnegative]

------------------------------------------------------------
Objective:
Minimize total fat intake:
  TotalFat = fat_fish * FishMeals + fat_chicken * ChickenMeals
In terms of the given parameters:
  Minimize: 7 * FishMeals + 10 * ChickenMeals

------------------------------------------------------------
Constraints:
1. Protein intake constraint:
   protein_fish * FishMeals + protein_chicken * ChickenMeals >= protein_requirement
   i.e., 10 * FishMeals + 15 * ChickenMeals >= 130

2. Iron intake constraint:
   iron_fish * FishMeals + iron_chicken * ChickenMeals >= iron_requirement
   i.e., 12 * FishMeals + 8 * ChickenMeals >= 120

3. Chicken-to-fish meal ratio constraint:
   ChickenMeals >= chicken_to_fish_ratio * FishMeals
   i.e., ChickenMeals >= 2 * FishMeals

------------------------------------------------------------
Model Comments:
- All units are assumed to be consistent per meal as described.
- Although meals are discrete in practice, the variables are modeled as continuous (float) as defined in the expected output schema.
- The objective focuses solely on minimizing fat intake, while nutritional constraints ensure the patient meets her protein and iron needs, and the preference for a higher count of chicken meals is also respected.

........................................................................................................................
--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Below is one complete formulation of the factory layout problem using the five-element framework.

--------------------------------------------------

Sets:
- P: set of products = {Phone, Laptop}

Parameters:
- total_space: total available factory floor space [sq. feet] = 100
- cost_per_sqft:
  • phone: cost per square foot for phone production [USD/sq.ft] = 12
  • laptop: cost per square foot for laptop production [USD/sq.ft] = 15
- net_revenue_per_sqft:
  • phone: net revenue per square foot for phone production [USD/sq.ft] = 50
  • laptop: net revenue per square foot for laptop production [USD/sq.ft] = 70
- labor_required:
  • phone: labor hours required per square foot for phone production [hours/sq.ft] = 2
  • laptop: labor hours required per square foot for laptop production [hours/sq.ft] = 3
- cost_limit: maximum spending for production inputs [USD] = 5000
- labor_limit: maximum labor hours available [hours] = 2000

Variables:
- x_p: allocated space for product p ∈ P in square feet (continuous variable, ≥ 0)
  • x_phone corresponds to space for phone production
  • x_laptop corresponds to space for laptop production

Objective:
- Maximize total net revenue = (net_revenue_per_sqft[phone] * x_phone) + (net_revenue_per_sqft[laptop] * x_laptop)
  (Note: The term “net revenue” already represents revenue in excess of other variable production costs. The production costs appear only as constraints through the spending limit.)

Constraints:
1. Space constraint:
   - x_phone + x_laptop ≤ total_space
2. Cost constraint:
   - (cost_per_sqft[phone] * x_phone) + (cost_per_sqft[laptop] * x_laptop) ≤ cost_limit
3. Labor constraint:
   - (labor_required[phone] * x_phone) + (labor_required[laptop] * x_laptop) ≤ labor_limit
4. Non-negativity:
   - For each p in P, x_p ≥ 0

--------------------------------------------------

Comments:
- All parameters are expressed with consistent units: space in square feet, cost and revenue in US dollars per square foot, and labor in hours per square foot.
- The decision variables (x_phone and x_laptop) represent how many square feet of the available 100 sq. feet are allocated to each product.
- The objective maximizes total net revenue subject to physical (space) and operational (labor and expenditure) constraints.

--------------------------------------------------

Alternative modeling note:
If one instead prefers to separately account for revenue and the cost of space allocation (i.e., treating revenue and cost as separate expressions), an alternative formulation would be:
  • Total revenue = (50 * x_phone) + (70 * x_laptop)
  • Total cost = (12 * x_phone) + (15 * x_laptop)
  • Then the net objective would be: maximize (Total revenue – Total cost)
In that case, the cost constraint (Total cost ≤ 5000) would still be enforced, and the objective would explicitly subtract total cost from total revenue. However, based on the phrase “net revenue” in the problem statement, the first formulation is the direct translation.

--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Below is the structured mathematical model following the five-element format.

------------------------------------------------------------
Sets:
- C: set of container types = {small, large}

------------------------------------------------------------
Parameters (all units are in “units”; note that water and powdered pill input quantities are provided per container, and the output is measured in paste “units”):
- water_req[c]: water required per container c
    • water_req[small] = 10 (units of water per small container)
    • water_req[large] = 20 (units of water per large container)
- pill_req[c]: powdered pill required per container c
    • pill_req[small] = 15 (units of powdered pill per small container)
    • pill_req[large] = 20 (units of powdered pill per large container)
- paste_out[c]: paste output per container c
    • paste_out[small] = 20 (units of paste per small container)
    • paste_out[large] = 30 (units of paste per large container)
- total_water: total available water = 500 (units)
- total_pill: total available powdered pill = 700 (units)

------------------------------------------------------------
Variables:
- x[c]: number of containers of type c to use
  • For each c in C, x[c] is a decision variable (assumed continuous for modeling, but naturally expected to be integer and nonnegative)
  • Domain: x[c] ≥ 0 (units may be “container uses”)

------------------------------------------------------------
Objective:
Maximize total paste output produced by the containers.
- Total_Paste = sum over c in C of (paste_out[c] * x[c])
In other words, maximize: 20*x[small] + 30*x[large]

------------------------------------------------------------
Constraints:
1. Water availability constraint:
   - For water: sum over c in C of (water_req[c] * x[c]) ≤ total_water
   - That is: 10*x[small] + 20*x[large] ≤ 500

2. Powdered pill availability constraint:
   - For pills: sum over c in C of (pill_req[c] * x[c]) ≤ total_pill
   - That is: 15*x[small] + 20*x[large] ≤ 700

------------------------------------------------------------
Notes:
- The units for water and pills are assumed to be consistent throughout the model.
- Although the decision variables x[small] and x[large] are defined here as continuous (floats) per the expected output schema, the context implies that they should be nonnegative integers for a practical implementation.
- If needed, one could include integrality constraints in an implementation.
- This formulation directly maps to typical Python or OR-Tools code using the variables, constraints, and objective defined above.

------------------------------------------------------------
Alternative Version (if fractional container use is not allowed):
- One might explicitly enforce that:
   • x[c] ∈ Z (nonnegative integers)
This additional condition would be added to the “Variables” section if an integer program is required.

Sets:
- M: set of machine types = {Traditional, Modern}

Parameters:

Variables:
- x[m] for m in M: acres of land allocated to machine m (continuous, in acres, >= 0)

Objective:
- Maximize total tea leaves picked = tea_yield[Traditional] * x[Traditional] + tea_yield[Modern] * x[Modern]

Constraints:
1. Land constraint: x[Traditional] + x[Modern] <= acres_total

3. Waste constraint: waste[Traditional] * x[Traditional] + waste[Modern] * x[Modern] <= waste_capacity

-----------------------------------------------------
This model assumes that acres can be fractionally allocated. If integer allocations (i.e., whole acres) are required, the variable x[m] should be defined as integer.

Objective:
- Minimize total trips = VanTrips + TruckTrips

3. Advertising Constraint: VanTrips must be strictly greater than TruckTrips.
   - Since trips are integer quantities, enforce VanTrips ≥ TruckTrips + 1

// Note: All units are consistent with the problem statement (boxes, dollars, trips).

........................................................................................................................
--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Below is the complete five‐element structured model that represents the problem exactly as described.

--------------------------------------------------

Sets:
- Vehicles = {Bike, Car}  
  (Note: Although only two types exist, we keep them separate for clarity.)

Parameters:
- capacity_Bike = 3   (number of people a bike can transport)
- capacity_Car = 5    (number of people a car can transport)
- min_people = 500    (minimum number of people to be transported)
- max_car_fraction = 0.4   (maximum allowed fraction of vehicles that can be cars)

Variables:
- NumberOfBikes: number of bikes used [nonnegative real number, assume integer in practical implementation]
- NumberOfCars: number of cars used [nonnegative real number, assume integer in practical implementation]

Objective:
- Minimize the total number of bikes, i.e., minimize NumberOfBikes  
  (Here, the assumption is that bikes are cheaper relative to limiting total vehicles but the goal is to reduce the deployed bike count.)

Constraints:
1. Transportation capacity constraint:  
   3 * NumberOfBikes + 5 * NumberOfCars >= 500  
   (This ensures that the combined capacity of bikes and cars covers at least 500 people.)

2. Car fraction constraint:  
   NumberOfCars <= 0.4 * (NumberOfBikes + NumberOfCars)  
   (This ensures that cars do not exceed 40% of the total vehicles used.)  

--------------------------------------------------

Additional Comments:
- Both NumberOfBikes and NumberOfCars are decision variables and although the expected output schema lists them as float, in practice they should be integers since you cannot use a fraction of a vehicle.
- All capacities and the minimum requirement are expressed in "people".
- The car fraction is expressed as a percentage (40%) in its decimal form (0.4) ensuring unit consistency with the overall count of vehicles.

This model is complete, self-contained, and logically consistent for implementing in any optimization solver such as OR-Tools or Python-based frameworks.

........................................................................................................................
--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Below is one complete formulation using the five‐element structure. Note that if you interpret “at most half as much chlorine as water softener” literally (chlorine ≤ ½ · water softener), then with the additional requirements (at least 200 units of chlorine and a fixed total of 500 units of chemicals) the set of constraints is actually inconsistent. (To see this, note that if chlorine ≤ ½ · water softener and total = chlorine + water softener, then even when chlorine is as high as allowed the maximum chlorine is 500/3 ≈ 166.67, which conflicts with the ≥200 requirement.) 

Because of this, an alternative formulation is provided at the end where the safety constraint is reversed (water softener ≤ 2 · chlorine) so that all numerical requirements can be met. In either case the objective is to minimize the total time for chemical effectiveness (with each unit of chlorine needing 1 minute and each unit of water softener 2 minutes) and the chemicals are applied sequentially (in one order or the other, so the total time is simply the sum of the two times).

──────────────────────────────
Main Model (using chlorine ≤ 0.5 · water softener)

Sets:
• ChemicalTypes = {Chlorine, WaterSoftener}

Parameters (all units in “units” for chemicals and “minutes per unit effectiveness” for time):
• min_chlorine = 200    // Minimum required chlorine units
• total_chemicals = 500   // Total units of chemicals to be added
• time_per_unit[Chlorine] = 1  // Minutes needed per unit of chlorine
• time_per_unit[WaterSoftener] = 2 // Minutes needed per unit of water softener
• max_chlorine_ratio = 0.5  // Safety constraint: chlorine must be at most half as much as water softener

Variables (continuous and assumed > 0 since both chemicals must be added):
• ChlorineUnits      : number of chlorine units to add
• WaterSoftenerUnits : number of water softener units to add

– We also define an auxiliary variable:
• TotalTime = time_per_unit[Chlorine] · ChlorineUnits + time_per_unit[WaterSoftener] · WaterSoftenerUnits
  (in minutes)

Objective:
Minimize TotalTime

Constraints:
1. Total chemical requirement: 
  ChlorineUnits + WaterSoftenerUnits = total_chemicals
2. Chlorine minimum requirement: 
  ChlorineUnits ≥ min_chlorine
3. Safety (ratio) constraint:
  ChlorineUnits ≤ max_chlorine_ratio * WaterSoftenerUnits

• Note: With min_chlorine = 200, total_chemicals = 500, and the safety constraint interpreted as chlorine ≤ 0.5 · water softener, a quick substitution (WaterSoftenerUnits = 500 − ChlorineUnits) shows 
  ChlorineUnits ≤ 0.5 · (500 − ChlorineUnits) ⟹ 1.5 · ChlorineUnits ≤ 500 ⟹ ChlorineUnits ≤ 333.33.
  However, since the safety inequality actually forces (if taken to its limit) ChlorineUnits ≤ (500 – ChlorineUnits)/2, then the maximum feasible chlorine would be only 500/3 ≈ 166.67. This contradicts the requirement ChlorineUnits ≥ 200. In other words, no feasible solution exists under these three constraints simultaneously.

──────────────────────────────
Alternative Model (swapping the safety constraint interpretation)

Suppose instead the safety requirement is intended so that “too much chlorine” is avoided by insisting that water softener is not more than double the chlorine, that is:
  WaterSoftenerUnits ≤ 2 · ChlorineUnits.
This guarantees that chlorine is at least half of the total chemicals (keeping its level in check) while allowing at least 200 chlorine units within a 500‐unit total.

Sets:
• ChemicalTypes = {Chlorine, WaterSoftener}

Parameters:
• min_chlorine = 200    // Minimum chlorine required (units)
• total_chemicals = 500   // Total chemicals required (units)
• time_per_unit[Chlorine] = 1  // Minutes per unit of chlorine
• time_per_unit[WaterSoftener] = 2 // Minutes per unit of water softener
• safety_ratio_alternative = 2 // Safety constraint: water softener must not exceed 2 × chlorine

Variables (continuous and > 0):
• ChlorineUnits
• WaterSoftenerUnits

Auxiliary Expression:
• TotalTime = ChlorineUnits * time_per_unit[Chlorine] + WaterSoftenerUnits * time_per_unit[WaterSoftener]

Objective:
Minimize TotalTime

Constraints:
1. Total chemicals: 
  ChlorineUnits + WaterSoftenerUnits = total_chemicals
2. Chlorine minimum: 
  ChlorineUnits ≥ min_chlorine
3. Safety (alternative ratio) constraint:
  WaterSoftenerUnits ≤ safety_ratio_alternative * ChlorineUnits

──────────────────────────────
Expected Output Schema

Below is a JSON object listing the decision variables and the objective (the remaining parts of the model would be used by a solver implementation):

{
  "variables": {
    "ChlorineAmount": "This represents the required minimum chlorine units (parameter value, e.g., 200)",
    "WaterSoftenerAmount": "This represents the water softener parameter information, if needed",

    "WaterSoftenerUnits": "Continuous variable representing the number of water softener units to add",
    "TotalTime": "Continuous variable representing the total time in minutes, calculated as (1 × ChlorineUnits + 2 × WaterSoftenerUnits)"
  },
  "objective": "Minimize TotalTime = ChlorineUnits + 2 · WaterSoftenerUnits"
}

──────────────────────────────
Summary

• The Main Model uses:
  Constraint 1: ChlorineUnits + WaterSoftenerUnits = 500,
  Constraint 2: ChlorineUnits ≥ 200,
  Constraint 3: ChlorineUnits ≤ 0.5 · WaterSoftenerUnits.
This model is mathematically precise but is infeasible given the provided numerical requirements.

• The Alternative Model (with safety constraint WaterSoftenerUnits ≤ 2 · ChlorineUnits) is feasible and may be compared if a reinterpretation of “at most half as much chlorine” is acceptable.

A coding agent can implement either version and compare their feasibility and performance based on the intended practical meaning.

--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Below is one complete mathematical model expressed using the five‐element framework. Note that when we translate the text as written we get a set of constraints that, when combined, lead to an infeasible model. In particular, requiring at least 200 units of chlorine while forcing “at most half as much chlorine as water softener” (i.e. chlorine ≤ ½ × water softener) together with a total of exactly 500 units implies that chlorine must be both at least 200 and no more than about 166.67 (since if chlorine = C then water softener = 500 – C and the ratio constraint becomes C ≤ ½ (500 – C), or C ≤ 166.67). 

Because that combination cannot be satisfied, two alternative versions of the model are provided below. The first (Main Model) follows the text verbatim. The second (Alternative Model) presents one natural fix (flipping the ratio inequality) so that ratio means “at least half as much chlorine as water softener” (i.e. chlorine ≥ ½ × water softener) while keeping the other requirements unchanged. A modeling or coding agent can compare both versions.

──────────────────────────────
Main Model (Verbatim Interpretation)

Sets:
  • CHEMICALS = {Chlorine, WaterSoftener}

Parameters:
  • chlorine_effectiveness_time = 1 minute per unit (time for each unit of chlorine to be effective)
  • water_softener_effectiveness_time = 2 minutes per unit
  • min_chlorine_units = 200 units (minimum required chlorine)
  • total_chemical_units = 500 units (total amount of chemicals to be added)
  • ratio_factor = 0.5  (the constraint “at most half as much chlorine as water softener” means: Chlorine_units ≤ 0.5 × WaterSoftener_units)

Variables:
  • ChlorineUnits (continuous, ≥ 0) – units of chlorine added
  • WaterSoftenerUnits (continuous, ≥ 0) – units of water softener added
  • TotalTime (continuous, ≥ 0) – total time (in minutes) required for both chemicals to be effective

Objective:
  • Minimize TotalTime defined as:
      TotalTime = chlorine_effectiveness_time × ChlorineUnits + water_softener_effectiveness_time × WaterSoftenerUnits

Constraints:
  1. Total Chemical Requirement:
         ChlorineUnits + WaterSoftenerUnits = total_chemical_units
  2. Minimum Chlorine Requirement:
         ChlorineUnits ≥ min_chlorine_units
  3. Ratio Constraint (to avoid too much chlorine):
         ChlorineUnits ≤ ratio_factor × WaterSoftenerUnits
  4. (Ordering note) Chlorine must be added before water softener or vice versa.
         (This note is acknowledged; here we assume that the chemicals are added in sequence and that their individual effectiveness times simply add up.)

Comments:
  • With total_chemical_units fixed at 500, constraint (1) implies WaterSoftenerUnits = 500 − ChlorineUnits.
  • Substituting into (3) we require ChlorineUnits ≤ 0.5 × (500 − ChlorineUnits), which simplifies to ChlorineUnits ≤ 166.67. This directly conflicts with (2) which requires ChlorineUnits ≥ 200.
  • Therefore, as written, the Main Model is infeasible. 

──────────────────────────────
Alternative Model (Adjusted Ratio Constraint)

(One common adjustment is to assume that “too much chlorine” is avoided by requiring that chlorine be at least half as much as water softener rather than at most. In this version, we replace constraint (3) by its flipped version.)

Sets:
  • CHEMICALS = {Chlorine, WaterSoftener}

Parameters:
  • chlorine_effectiveness_time = 1 minute per unit
  • water_softener_effectiveness_time = 2 minutes per unit
  • min_chlorine_units = 200 units
  • total_chemical_units = 500 units
  • ratio_factor = 0.5  
       (Now the ratio constraint is interpreted as: ChlorineUnits ≥ ratio_factor × WaterSoftenerUnits,
       i.e. there must be at least half as much chlorine as water softener.)

Variables:
  • ChlorineUnits (continuous, ≥ 0) – units of chlorine added
  • WaterSoftenerUnits (continuous, ≥ 0) – units of water softener added
  • TotalTime (continuous, ≥ 0) – total time (in minutes) for the pool to be ready

Objective:
  • Minimize TotalTime defined by:
         TotalTime = chlorine_effectiveness_time × ChlorineUnits + water_softener_effectiveness_time × WaterSoftenerUnits

Constraints:
  1. Total Chemical Requirement:
         ChlorineUnits + WaterSoftenerUnits = total_chemical_units
  2. Minimum Chlorine Requirement:
         ChlorineUnits ≥ min_chlorine_units
  3. Adjusted Ratio Constraint:
         ChlorineUnits ≥ ratio_factor × WaterSoftenerUnits
         (Equivalently, WaterSoftenerUnits ≤ 2 × ChlorineUnits)
  4. Chemical Addition Ordering:
         (The problem note “chlorine must be added before water softener or vice versa” is acknowledged.
         We assume here that because the chemicals are added sequentially, the overall effective time is the sum of the individual times.)

Comments:
  • With constraint (1), WaterSoftenerUnits = 500 − ChlorineUnits.
  • Constraint (3) becomes ChlorineUnits ≥ 0.5 × (500 − ChlorineUnits), i.e. ChlorineUnits ≥ 250/1.5 approximately, which is feasible with ChlorineUnits ≥ 200.
  • In this alternative formulation, a candidate optimal solution will balance the lower (faster) time for chlorine with the higher (slower) time for water softener while meeting the ratio and total chemical requirements.

Summary

• The Main Model follows the given text exactly, but its three constraints (chlorine ≥ 200, total = 500, and chlorine ≤ 0.5 × water softener) are mutually contradictory.
• The Alternative Model modifies the ratio so that chlorine is at least half of water softener, which may be a more reasonable interpretation and leads to a feasible optimization model.
• A coder can choose which version to implement or compare both to check the impact on the solution.

Problem description: Both chorine and water softener need to be added to a pool. One unit of chlorine takes 1 minute to be effective while one unit of water softener takes 2 minutes to be effective. Because too much chlorine can burn your eyes, there has to at most half as much chlorine as water softener in the pool. If there has to be at least 200 units of chlorine in the water and a total of 500 units of chemicals in the water, how many units of each should be added to minimize the total time it takes for the pool to be ready? (Note: chlorine must be added before water softener or vice versa).

........................................................................................................................
--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Below is a complete, self-contained formulation using the five-element framework. In this formulation the decision is about how many units of each chemical to add. We assume that “ChlorineAmount” is the effective quantity of chlorine (in units) added (and equivalently for water softener) and that the total time is the sum of the individual times (1 minute per chlorine unit and 2 minutes per water softener unit). Note that because the chemicals must be added sequentially (one before the other), the total time is the sum of the individual addition times.

────────────────────────────
Sets:
- CHEMICALS: the set of chemicals = {Chlorine, WaterSoftener}

────────────────────────────
Parameters:
- min_chlorine_units = 200           (minimum required chlorine units)
- total_chemical_units = 500         (total units of chemicals required)
- time_per_unit_Chlorine = 1         (minutes required for one unit of chlorine)
- time_per_unit_WaterSoftener = 2    (minutes required for one unit of water softener)
- chlorine_ratio_limit = 0.5         (chlorine units must be at most half the water softener units)

────────────────────────────
Variables:
- ChlorineUnits (continuous, ≥ 0): the number of chlorine units added [units]
- WaterSoftenerUnits (continuous, ≥ 0): the number of water softener units added [units]
- ChlorineAmount (continuous): defined as the effective amount of chlorine in the pool (equal to ChlorineUnits) [units]
- WaterSoftenerAmount (continuous): defined as the effective amount of water softener in the pool (equal to WaterSoftenerUnits) [units]
- TotalTime (continuous): the total time for the pool to be ready, computed as (1 minute * ChlorineUnits) + (2 minutes * WaterSoftenerUnits) [minutes]

────────────────────────────
Objective:
Minimize TotalTime = ChlorineUnits * time_per_unit_Chlorine + WaterSoftenerUnits * time_per_unit_WaterSoftener  
(which in numerical terms is: minimize TotalTime = ChlorineUnits + 2 * WaterSoftenerUnits)

────────────────────────────
Constraints:
1. Chlorine minimum requirement:  
   ChlorineUnits ≥ min_chlorine_units  
   (i.e., ChlorineUnits ≥ 200)

2. Total chemicals requirement:  
   ChlorineUnits + WaterSoftenerUnits = total_chemical_units  
   (i.e., ChlorineUnits + WaterSoftenerUnits = 500)

3. Chlorine to water softener ratio limit:  
   ChlorineUnits ≤ chlorine_ratio_limit * WaterSoftenerUnits  
   (i.e., ChlorineUnits ≤ 0.5 * WaterSoftenerUnits)

4. Non-negativity:  
   ChlorineUnits ≥ 0 and WaterSoftenerUnits ≥ 0

────────────────────────────
Additional Comments:
- The sequential requirement (that chlorine must be added before water softener, or vice versa) is captured by the fact that total time is computed as the sum of the individual effective times.
- All units are assumed to be consistent (units in quantity and minutes in time).  
- This model is directly mappable to code (for example, in Python using an optimization package) and remains faithful to the original problem description.

The expected output schema variables (ChlorineAmount, WaterSoftenerAmount, ChlorineUnits, WaterSoftenerUnits, TotalTime) appear in the decision or derived variables as defined above, with the objective being the minimized TotalTime.

........................................................................................................................
--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Below is one complete formulation using the five‐element framework. Note that when we translate the verbal conditions directly we obtain an infeasible set of constraints. In particular, if we define

  • Chlorine + WaterSoftener = 500 (total chemical units)  
  • Chlorine >= 200 (at least 200 units chlorine) and  
  • Chlorine <= 0.5 × WaterSoftener (chlorine is “at most half as much as” water softener)

then substituting WaterSoftener = 500 – Chlorine leads to  
  Chlorine <= 0.5 × (500 – Chlorine)  
  1.5 × Chlorine <= 500  
  Chlorine <= 333.33 …  
but a further inspection shows that in any feasible allocation (where WaterSoftener is positive) the chlorine maximum would in fact be below 200. (For example, rearranging the ratio constraint gives Chlorine <= (500 – Chlorine)/2, which implies Chlorine <= 166.67.) 

Because of this inconsistency the decision maker might need to review the figures (for example, the required minimum chlorine or the ratio requirement). Below you will find the direct formulation (Model Version 1) and then an alternative (Model Version 2) in which one might “flip” the ratio meaning to assume instead that chlorine must be at least half as much as water softener (i.e. Chlorine >= 0.5 × WaterSoftener). Both versions are provided for completeness.

────────────────────────────
Main Model (Version 1 – Direct Interpretation):

Sets:
  • ChemicalTypes = {Chlorine, WaterSoftener}

Parameters:
  • min_chlorine = 200      [units; minimum required chlorine]
  • total_chemicals = 500     [units; total chemicals in the pool]
  • time_per_unit_chlorine = 1  [minute per unit of chlorine]
  • time_per_unit_ws = 2      [minute per unit of water softener]
  • chlorine_ratio_bound = 0.5  [ratio; chlorine must be at most 0.5 times water softener]

Variables (decision variables – assumed continuous):
  • ChlorineAmount (or ChlorineUnits): amount of chlorine added [units; ≥ 0]
  • WaterSoftenerAmount (or WaterSoftenerUnits): amount of water softener added [units; ≥ 0]
  • TotalTime: total time required to achieve effectiveness [minutes; ≥ 0]

Objective:
  Minimize TotalTime =
   (time_per_unit_chlorine × ChlorineAmount) + (time_per_unit_ws × WaterSoftenerAmount)

Constraints:
  1. Total Chemical Constraint:
   ChlorineAmount + WaterSoftenerAmount = total_chemicals
                   (i.e. 500 units)

  2. Minimum Chlorine Requirement:
   ChlorineAmount >= min_chlorine
             (i.e. at least 200 units chlorine)

  3. Chlorine-to-WaterSoftener Ratio Constraint:
   ChlorineAmount <= chlorine_ratio_bound × WaterSoftenerAmount
          (i.e. chlorine is at most half as much as water softener)

  4. Sequential Addition Note (model comment):
   Because chemicals must be added one after the other (order does not change the overall sum of times), the total effective time is given by the sum in the objective.

Model Comments:
  – Units: Chemical amounts are in “units” and time is in minutes.
  – In this direct formulation, the constraints lead to an infeasible model because the requirement of at least 200 chlorine units conflicts with the ratio constraint when total chemicals equal 500.
  – The coding agent should verify the model parameters with the decision maker.

────────────────────────────
Alternative Model (Version 2 – Adjusted Ratio Interpretation):

Here we assume that the intended ratio constraint was meant to be interpreted in the opposite direction. That is, to alleviate eye irritation the pool needs a minimum relative amount of chlorine such that
   ChlorineAmount >= 0.5 × WaterSoftenerAmount.
Note that with this alternative the ratio constraint is reversed. The remaining requirements and total chemicals remain the same.

Sets:
  • ChemicalTypes = {Chlorine, WaterSoftener}

Parameters:
  • min_chlorine = 200      [units]
  • total_chemicals = 500     [units]
  • time_per_unit_chlorine = 1  [minute per unit of chlorine]
  • time_per_unit_ws = 2      [minute per unit of water softener]
  • chlorine_ratio_lower_bound = 0.5  [ratio; chlorine must be at least 0.5 times water softener]

Variables:
  • ChlorineAmount (or ChlorineUnits): amount of chlorine added [units; ≥ 0]
  • WaterSoftenerAmount (or WaterSoftenerUnits): amount of water softener added [units; ≥ 0]
  • TotalTime: total time required [minutes; ≥ 0]

Objective:
  Minimize TotalTime =
   (time_per_unit_chlorine × ChlorineAmount) + (time_per_unit_ws × WaterSoftenerAmount)

Constraints:
  1. Total Chemical Constraint:
   ChlorineAmount + WaterSoftenerAmount = total_chemicals

  2. Minimum Chlorine Requirement:
   ChlorineAmount >= min_chlorine

  3. Adjusted Ratio Constraint:
   ChlorineAmount >= chlorine_ratio_lower_bound × WaterSoftenerAmount
     (i.e. chlorine is at least half as much as water softener)

  4. Sequential Addition Note:
   As before, the total time is the sum of the individual chemical’s effective times because the chemicals are added sequentially.

Model Comments:
  – With the alternative interpretation the feasible region becomes:
   WaterSoftenerAmount = total_chemicals – ChlorineAmount,
   and ChlorineAmount must lie in a range where both the minimum chlorine requirement and the ratio constraint are satisfied.
  – Units and variables are defined as in Model Version 1.
  – The decision maker should compare both models to decide which best reflects the physical process.

Expected Output Format (Summary):

  "variables": {

    "ChlorineUnits": "float",
    "WaterSoftenerUnits": "float",
    "TotalTime": "float"
  },
  "objective": "float"
}

In this summary, note that ChlorineAmount and ChlorineUnits represent the same decision variable (and similarly for WaterSoftener). The objective, in both versions, is the minimization of the weighted sum of times associated with each chemical.

This completes the structured formulation of the problem using the five‐element framework.

--> Mathematical Problem Formulation:
Below is one complete formulation following the five‐element structure. Note that when the ratio constraint is interpreted in the most natural way (“there has to be at most half as much chlorine as water softener” is modeled as chlorine ≤ 0.5 × water softener), the numerical requirements (at least 200 chlorine units and a 500‑unit total) are mutually inconsistent. In the comments an alternative interpretation is provided.

Sets:
- CHEM: set of chemicals = {Chlorine, WaterSoftener}

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Parameters:
- time_effect[C] for C in CHEM:
  • time_effect[Chlorine] = 1            (minutes per unit)
  • time_effect[WaterSoftener] = 2        (minutes per unit)
- min_chlorine = 200               (minimum units required for Chlorine)
- total_units = 500               (total chemical units to be added)
- ratio_limit = 0.5                (upper bound on Chlorine relative to WaterSoftener)
  • Note: Interpreted as “Chlorine units ≤ 0.5 × WaterSoftener units”. 
  • Alternative interpretation (if intended to avoid infeasibility): “WaterSoftener units ≤ 0.5 × Chlorine units.”

Variables:
- Chlorine_units: [continuous ≥ 0]  (units of Chlorine added)
- WaterSoftener_units: [continuous ≥ 0]  (units of Water Softener added)
- TotalTime: [continuous ≥ 0]  (total time in minutes for the process)

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Objective:
Minimize TotalTime, where
 TotalTime = (time_effect[Chlorine] × Chlorine_units) + (time_effect[WaterSoftener] × WaterSoftener_units)
  i.e., TotalTime = 1 × Chlorine_units + 2 × WaterSoftener_units

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Constraints:
1. Total chemical units requirement:
  Chlorine_units + WaterSoftener_units = total_units

2. Minimum chlorine requirement:
  Chlorine_units ≥ min_chlorine

3. Eye safety (chlorine ratio) constraint:
  Chlorine_units ≤ ratio_limit × WaterSoftener_units
    (Interpretation A – natural reading: There should be at most half as much Chlorine as WaterSoftener.)
    • Note: With min_chlorine = 200 and total_units = 500, this constraint implies: Chlorine_units ≤ 0.5 × (500 − Chlorine_units) → Chlorine_units ≤ 166.67, which conflicts with Constraint 2.
     An alternative (Interpretation B) is to reverse the ratio:
      WaterSoftener_units ≤ ratio_limit × Chlorine_units
     which would read “water softener is at most half as much as chlorine” (a less natural reading given the fear of burning eyes but might be considered if a feasible solution is desired).

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Model Comments:
• Under Interpretation A, the constraints are infeasible because the requirement of at least 200 Chlorine units cannot be met together with the safety ratio constraint when total_units = 500.
• The coding agent can either report the infeasibility or consider using the alternative ratio (Interpretation B) by replacing Constraint 3 with:
  WaterSoftener_units ≤ ratio_limit × Chlorine_units.
• All time units are in minutes and the amount parameters for chemicals are in “units” (assumed consistent across the model).
