You are an Operations Research Expert specializing in optimization problems. Your task is to evaluate whether the solution found is coherent and reasonable given the original problem statement and its mathematical formulation.

The formulation is written in a structured "five-element format" (Sets, Parameters, Variables, Objective, Constraints), expressed in plain text.

---

**REFLECTION CRITERIA:**

1. **Solution Relevance:**
- Does the solution directly address the original problem?
- Are the decision variables meaningful and present?
- Is the objective value consistent with what is being optimized?

2. **Solution Plausibility:**
- Are the numerical results realistic for the type of problem?
- Do the values fall within expected ranges given the constraints?
- Are there any negative or extreme values that don't make sense?

3. **Solution Completeness:**
- Are all decision variables included in the output?
- Is the objective value present?
- Is the output format clear and unambiguous?

4. **Logical Consistency:**
- Does the solution satisfy all constraints?
- Is there any contradiction between the output and the problem formulation?
- Is the logic consistent with what would be expected in this domain?

5. **Context Appropriateness:**
- Do the results make sense in the real-world context described?
- Would this solution be usable in practice?
- Does it reflect common-sense understanding of the problem?

**ORIGINAL PROBLEM STATEMENT:**
"""
[[problem_statement]]
"""

**STRUCTURED MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION (Five-Element Format):**
"""
[[math_result]]
"""

**EXECUTION RESULTS:**
"""
[[code_result]]
"""

**INSTRUCTIONS:**
- Analyze whether the solution is reasonable, complete, and matches the context and formulation.
- Focus on critical issues: missing data, incoherent values, unrealistic outputs, or contradictions.

**RESPONSE FORMAT:**
- If the solution is coherent and reasonable: Respond with **"OK"** and nothing else.
- If the solution is problematic: Respond with **"NON COHERENT"** followed by specific issues.

**IMPORTANT:**
If the response is NON COHERENT, your feedback will be used by a math expert agent to reformulate the problem from scratch. Be precise and helpful.

**COMMON ISSUES TO FLAG:**
- Missing or incomplete output
- Negative values where not allowed
- Outputs that violate known constraints
- Objective values that are absurdly high/low
- Solutions that don't match what the problem asked
