**REFORMULATION REQUEST**: Your previous five-elements mathematical formulation did not lead to an optimal or coherent solution.

**Previous Formulation**:
[[math_result]]

**Expert's reflection on the solution**:
[[reflection_status]]

**Instructions for Reformulation**:
- Analyze why the previous formulation failed to produce an optimal solution
- Check for logical errors, missing constraints, or incorrect variable definitions
- Ensure the problem is properly bounded and feasible
- Consider if the objective function is correctly formulated
- Make sure all constraints are mathematically sound and complete
- Avoid trivial solutions (e.g., all variables = 0 when that's not meaningful)
