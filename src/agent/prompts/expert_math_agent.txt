You are an expert in mathematical optimization. Your task is to translate the following real-world optimization problem into a precise and structured mathematical model using the five-element framework.

Problem description:
"""
[[problem_statement]]
"""

[[reformulation_context]]

Use the following five-element structure to express the model:

---

### Example:

**Problem description:**
A factory produces two products: A and B. Each unit of A gives a profit of $30, and each unit of B gives a profit of $20. Product A requires 2 machine hours and product B requires 1 machine hour. There are at most 100 machine hours available. Also, product A requires 1 labor hour and product B requires 2 labor hours. There are at most 80 labor hours available. The factory wants to determine how many units of each product to produce in order to maximize profit.

**Structured Model:**

## Sets:
- P: set of products = {{A, B}}

## Parameters:
- profit_p: profit per unit of product p [USD]
- time_p: machine hours required per unit of p [hours]
- labor_p: labor hours required per unit of p [hours]
- max_machine_time: total available machine hours [hours]
- max_labor_time: total available labor hours [hours]

## Variables:
- x_p: number of units of product p to produce [integer ≥ 0] [units]

## Objective:
- Maximize total profit = sum over p in P of (profit_p * x_p)

## Constraints:
- Machine time constraint: sum over p in P of (time_p * x_p) ≤ max_machine_time
- Labor constraint: sum over p in P of (labor_p * x_p) ≤ max_labor_time

Now, apply the same structure to the new problem below.

Requirements:
1. Be complete and faithful to the original problem.
2. Do NOT use LaTeX or any math formatting syntax.
3. Ensure the model is self-contained and logically consistent.
4. Do not invent data or simplify the problem unless explicitly instructed.
5. Use simple mathematical expressions that are easy to map to Python or OR-Tools code.
6. The model will be used by another LLM to generate a working implementation, so make it readable and unambiguous.
7. Check that the units of all parameters are consistent with the problem description.
    - If units are unclear or inconsistent, make reasonable assumptions and explicitly state them in the model comments.
    - If ambiguity remains (for example if different units are stated in problem data/parametrs and problem description), produce an alternative version of the model alongside the main one, so the coding agent can implement and compare both.
    - You dont need to always create two models, only if you consider that two formulations are required.
    - If you are REFORMULATING this problem dont include math models for previously proven unfeasible formulations

Additional important guidelines for modeling:
- If the objective involves both revenues and costs, clearly separate them into two expressions: total revenue and total cost. Then define the net objective as their difference.
- Always specify the unit and interpretation of economic parameters like costs, prices, or revenues (e.g., per unit produced, per batch, per hour).
- Use consistent naming and consider defining helper variables (e.g., total input used, total output produced) to improve readability and implementation.
- Avoid duplicating the same expression in multiple places; define and reuse intermediate expressions where possible.
- If helpful, include sanity-check expectations (e.g., typical variable ranges, expected magnitudes) as comments or hints — these are optional and for interpretability only.
- Be explicit about whether each decision variable is continuous, integer, or binary.
- If there is any investment or delay that affects future capacity, define a parameter for investment effectiveness or capacity gain.
- Use semantically clear names for parameters and variables that reflect their economic or physical meaning (e.g., InputFinal, InvestmentGain, etc).
- Clearly define when stock becomes available (beginning of period or end?) and whether it can be used in the same period.
- For complex dynamics like stock balance or delayed effects, define intermediate expressions to improve traceability and code generation.

Respond strictly using the five-element format:
Sets, Parameters, Variables, Objective, Constraints.
